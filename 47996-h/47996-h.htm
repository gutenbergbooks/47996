      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ixteen of the
      twenty papers comprised in this volume appeared in America; but only one
      of these&mdash;'The Citizen of the World'&mdash;has been reprinted in
      England. Of the four papers remaining, one was published (in part) in the
      <i>Saturday Review</i>, and the other three in <i>Longman's Magazine</i>,
      the <i>National Review</i>, and the <i>Library</i> respectively. Where
      permission to reprint was required, it has been obtained; and it is hereby
      gratefully acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the last two, which are more general in character
      than the rest, the papers are now chronologically arranged. They do not by
      any means exhaust the list of subjects originally drawn up by their writer
      for the kind of episodical treatment at which they aim; and should these
      first experiments find a public, it is not impossible that they may be
      followed by a further collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first series of 'Eighteenth Century Vignettes' was succeeded in 1894
      by a second, and in 1896 by a third series. The second and third series
      were printed at the Chiswick Press; the first was printed from American
      plates. In issuing a second and revised edition of this first series, it
      has been thought desirable to print the book in England. It has also been
      extended by a further paper&mdash;'At Leicester Fields.' This originally
      appeared in the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i> for August, 1886, but
      has now been corrected to date and very materially enlarged.

    <h2>
      I. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY VIGNETTES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the 19th of May,
      1708, Her Majesty Queen Anne being then upon the throne of Great Britain
      and Ireland, a coach with two horses, gaudy rather than neat in its
      appointments, drew up at the door of my Lord Sunderland's Office in
      Whitehall. It contained a lady about thirty, of considerable personal
      attractions, and dressed richly in cinnamon satin. She was a brunette,
      with a rather high forehead, the height of which was ingeniously broken by
      two short locks upon the temples. Moreover, she had distinctly fine eyes,
      and a mouth which, in its normal state, must have been arch and pretty,
      but was now drawn down at the corners under the influence of some
      temporary irritation. As the coach stopped, a provincial-looking servant
      promptly alighted, pulled out from the box-seat a large case of the kind
      used for preserving the voluminous periwigs of the period, and
      subsequently extracted from the same receptacle a pair of shining new
      shoes with square toes and silver buckles. These, with the case, he
      carried carefully into the house, returning shortly afterwards. Then
      ensued what, upon the stage, would be called 'an interval' during which
      time the high forehead of the lady began to cloud visibly with impatience,
      and the corners of her mouth to grow more ominous. At length, about twenty
      minutes later, came a sound of laughter and noisy voices; and by-and-by
      bustled out of the Cockpit portal a square-shouldered, square-faced man in
      a rich dress, which, like the coach, was a little showy. He wore a huge
      black full-bottomed periwig. Speaking with a marked Irish accent, he made
      profuse apologies to the occupant of the carriage&mdash;apologies which,
      as might be expected, were not well received. An expression of vexation
      came over his good-tempered face as he took his seat at the lady's side,
      and he lapsed for a few minutes into a moody silence. But before they had
      gone many yards, his dark, deep-set eyes began to twinkle once more as he
      looked about him. When they passed the Tilt-Yard a detachment of the
      Second Troop of Life Guards, magnificent in their laced red coats, jack
      boots, and white feathers, came pacing out on their black horses. They
      took their way towards Charing Cross, and for a short distance followed
      the same route as the chariot. The lady was loftily indifferent to their
      presence; and she was, besides, on the further side of the vehicle. But
      her companion manifestly recognized some old acquaintances among them, and
      was highly gratified at being recognized in his turn, although at the same
      time it was evident he was also a little apprehensive lest the 'Gentlemen
      of the Guard,' as they were called, should be needlessly demonstrative in
      their acknowledgment of his existence. After this, nothing more of moment
      occurred. Slowly mounting St. James's Street, the coach turned down
      Piccadilly, and, passing between the groups of lounging lackeys at the
      gate, entered Hyde Park. Here, by the time it had once made the circuit of
      the Ring, the lady's equanimity was completely restored, and the gentleman
      was radiant. He was, in truth, to use his own words, 'no undelightful
      Companion.' He possessed an infinite fund of wit and humour; and his
      manner to women had a sincerity of deference which was not the prevailing
      characteristic of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but slender invention in this little picture. The gentleman was
      Captain Steele, late of the Life Guards, the Coldstreams, and Lucas's
      regiment of foot, now Gazetteer, and Gentleman Waiter to Queen Anne's
      consort, Prince George of Denmark, and not yet 'Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff' of
      the immortal 'Tatler.' The lady was Mrs. Steele, <i>née</i> Miss Mary
      Scurlock, his 'Ruler' and 'absolute Governesse' (as he called her), to
      whom he had been married some eight months before. If you ask at the
      British Museum for the Steele manuscripts (Add. MSS. 5,145, A, B, and C),
      the courteous attendant will bring you, with its faded ink, dusky paper,
      and hasty scrawl, the very letter making arrangements for this meeting
      ('best Periwigg' and 'new Shoes' included), at the end of which the writer
      assures his 'dear Prue' (another pet name) that she is 'Vitall Life to YT
      Oblig'd Affectionate Husband &amp; Humble Sernt Richd Steele.' There are
      many such in the quarto volume of which this forms part, written from all
      places, at all times, in all kinds of hands. They take all tones; they are
      passionate, tender, expostulatory, playful, dignified, lyric, didactic. It
      must be confessed that from a perusal of them one's feeling for the lady
      of the chariot is not entirely unsympathetic. It can scarcely have been an
      ideal household, that 'third door right hand turning out of Jermyn
      Street,' to which so many of them are addressed; and Mrs. Steele must
      frequently have had to complain to her <i>confidante</i>, Mrs. (or Miss)
      Binns (a lady whom Steele is obviously anxious to propitiate), of the
      extraordinary irregularity of her restless lord and master. Now a friend
      from Barbados has stopped him on his way home, and he will come (he
      writes) 'within a Pint of Wine;' now it is Lord Sunderland who is keeping
      him indefinitely at the Council; now the siege of Lille and the proofs of
      the 'Gazette' will detain him until ten at night. Sometimes his vague
      'West Indian business' (that is, his first wife's property) hurries him
      suddenly into the City; sometimes he is borne off to the Gentleman Ushers'
      table at St. James's. Sometimes, even, he stays out all night, as he had
      done not many days before the date of the above meeting, when he had
      written to beg that his dressing-gown, his slippers, and 'clean Linnen'
      might be sent to him at 'one Legg's,' a barber 'over against the Devill
      Tavern at Charing Crosse,' where he proposes to lie that night, chiefly,
      it has been conjectured from the context, in order to escape certain
      watchful 'shoulder-dabbers' who were hanging obstinately about his own
      mansion in St. James's. For&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;he was generally
      hopelessly embarrassed, and scarcely ever without a lawsuit on his hands.
      He was not a bad man; he was not necessarily vicious or dissolute. But his
      habits were incurably generous, profuse, and improvident; and his sanguine
      Irish nature led him continually to mistake his expectations for his
      income. Naturally, perhaps, his 'absolute Governesse' complained of an
      absolutism so strangely limited. If her affection for him was scarcely as
      ardent as his passion for her, it was still a genuine emotion. But to a
      coquette of some years' standing, and 'a cried-up beauty' (as Mrs. Manley
      calls her), the realities of her married life must have been a cruel
      disappointment; and she was not the woman to conceal it. 'I wish,' says
      her husband in one of his letters, 'I knew how to Court you into Good
      Humour, for Two or Three Quarrells more will dispatch me quite.' Of her
      replies we have no knowledge; but from scattered specimens of her style
      when angry, they must often have been exceptionally scornful and
      unconciliatory. On one occasion, where he addresses her as 'Madam,' and
      returns her note to her in order that she may see, upon second thoughts,
      the disrespectful manner in which she treats him, he is evidently deeply
      wounded. She has said that their dispute is far from being a trouble to
      her, and he rejoins that to him any disturbance between them is the
      greatest affliction imaginable. And then he goes on to expostulate, with
      more dignity than usual, against her unreasonable use of her prerogative.
      'I Love you,' he says, 'better than the light of my Eyes, or the
      life-blood in my Heart but when I have lett you know that, you are also to
      understand that neither my sight shall be so far inchanted, or my
      affection so much master of me as to make me forgett our common Interest.
      To attend my businesse as I ought and improve my fortune it is necessary
      that my time and my Will should be under no direction but my own.' Clearly
      his bosom's queen had been inquiring too closely into his goings and
      comings. It is a strange thing, he says, in another letter, that, because
      she is handsome, he must be always giving her an account of every trifle,
      and minute of his time. And again&mdash;'Dear Prue, do not send after me,
      for I shall be ridiculous:' It had happened to him, no doubt. 'He is
      governed by his wife most abominably, as bad as Marlborough,' says another
      contemporary letter-writer. And we may fancy the blue eyes of Dr. Swift
      flashing unutterable scorn as he scribbles off this piece of intelligence
      to Stella and Mrs. Dingley.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the letters which follow Steele's above-quoted expostulation, the
      embers of misunderstanding flame and fade, to flame and fade again. A word
      or two of kindness makes him rapturous; a harsh expression sinks him to
      despair. As time goes on, the letters grow fewer, and the writers grow
      more used to each other's ways. But to the last Steele's affectionate
      nature takes fire upon the least encouragement. Once, years afterwards,
      when Prue is in the country and he is in London, and she calls him 'Good
      Dick,' it throws him into such a transport that he declares he could
      forget his gout, and walk down to her at Wales. 'My dear little peevish,
      beautiful, wise Governess, God bless you,' the letter ends. In another he
      assures her that, lying in her place and on her pillow, he fell into tears
      from thinking that his 'charming little insolent might be then awake and
      in pain'-.with headache. She wants flattery, she says, and he flatters
      her. 'Her son,' he declares, 'is extremely pretty, and has his face
      sweetened with something of the Venus his mother, which is no small
      delight to the Vulcan who begot him.' He assures her that, though she
      talks of the children, they are dear to him more because they are hers
      than because they are his own. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A few sentences in this paper are borrowed from the
     writer's 'Life of Steele,' 1886.
</pre>
    <p>
      And this reminds us that some of the best of his later letters are about
      his family. Once, at this time of their mother's absence in Wales, he says
      that he has invited his eldest daughter to dinner with one of her
      teachers, because she had represented to him 'in her pretty language that
      she seemed helpless and friendless, without anybody's taking notice of her
      at Christmas, when all the children but she and two more were with their
      relations.' So now they are in the room where he is writing. 'I told
      Betty,' he adds, 'I had writ to you; and she made me open the letter
      again, and give her humble duty to her mother, and desire to know when she
      shall have the honour to see her in town.' No doubt this was in strict
      accordance with the proprieties as practised at Mrs. Nazereau's polite
      academy in Chelsea; but somehow one suspects that 'Madam Betty' would
      scarcely have addressed the writer of the letter with the same
      boarding-school formality. 'Elsewhere the talk is all of Eugene, the
      eldest boy. 'Your son, at the present writing, is mighty well employed in
      tumbling on the floor of the room and sweeping the sand with a feather. He
      grows a most delightful child, and very full of play and spirit. He is
      also a very great scholar: he can read his Primer; and I have brought down
      my Virgil. He makes most shrewd remarks upon the pictures. We are very
      intimate friends and play-fellows.' Yes: decidedly Steele's children must
      have loved their clever, faulty, kindly father.

    <h2>
      II. PRIOR'S 'KITTY.'
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the year 1718,
      and presumably after Mr. Matthew Prior had already printed his tall and
      extremely miscellaneous <i>folio</i> of 'Poems on Several Occasions,'
      there was published separately a little <i>jeu d'esprit</i> by the same
      'eminent Hand,' which has not been regarded as the least fortunate of his
      efforts. In its first fugitive form, now so rare as to be known only to a
      few highly-favoured collectors, it is a single page or leaf of eight
      quatrains; and of this there are two issues, both attributing the verses
      to Prior, both claiming to be authentic, both unauthorised. The earlier,
      which is dated, is headed 'Upon Lady <i>Katherine H&mdash;des</i> first
      appearing at the <i>Play-House</i> in <i>Drury-Lane</i>;' the other, 'from
      Curll's chaste press,' bears the title of 'The Female Phaeton,' by which
      the piece is now known. The person indicated was the second daughter of
      Henry Hyde, Earl of Clarendon and Rochester, and the grandchild of the
      great Lord Chancellor and historian of the Rebellion. As she was born in
      1700, she must at this time have been eighteen. She was 'beautiful,' says
      the poet; 'she was wild as Colt untam'd;' she was, besides,

      Her elder sister, Jane&mdash;the 'blooming <i>Hide,</i> with Eyes so

      Apart from the reference to Drury Lane Theatre supplied by the title,
      there is no clue to the incident recorded. But two years after Prior wrote
      these playful verses, which were sent to the lady through Mr. Harcourt,
      Catherine Hyde verified her poet's words by securing a suitor of even
      higher rank than her sister's husband. In March, 1720, she married Charles
      Douglas, third Duke of Queensberry, an amiable and accomplished nobleman,
      who, it has been hinted, must sometimes have been considerably 'exercised'
      by the vagaries of the charming but impetuous 'child of Nature' whom he
      had selected for his helpmate. Indeed, despite her ability, many of her
      less sympathetic contemporaries did not scruple to suggest that her
      Grace's eccentricities almost amounted to a touch of insanity. Bolingbroke
      called her '<i>Sa Singularité</i>;' Walpole spoke of her roundly as 'an
      out-pensioner of Bedlam.' But neither the Abbot of Strawberry nor Pope's
      'guide, philosopher, and friend' had any right to set up for a
      Forbes-Winslow or a Brouardel; and there is in reality little more in what
      is related of her than might be expected of one who, at once a spoiled
      child, a beauty, and a woman of parts, deliberately revolted against the
      tyrannous conventionalities of her time. To the last she persistently
      declined, as she told Swift, to 'cut and curl her hair like a sheep's
      head,' in accordance with the reigning fashion; and she affected in her
      dress a simplicity and youthfulness which nothing but the good looks she
      contrived to retain so long, could possibly have justified. She had a
      fancy for idyllic travesties, appearing now as a shepherdess, now as a
      peasant, now as a milkmaid. *

     * In this last character Charles Jervas painted her. The
     picture is in the National Portrait Gallery. She has hazel
     eyes and dark-brown hair.

    <p>
      Upon one occasion she scandalized the court-usher soul of Horace Walpole
      by masquerading at St. James's in a costume of red flannel. As a rule, she
      carried her innovations triumphantly; but now and then she was forced to
      yield to a will more imperative than her own. Once the fantastic old King
      of Rath tore off her favourite white apron in the Pump Room, flinging it
      contemptuously among the 'waiting gentlewomen' in the hinder benches.
      'None but abigails wore white aprons,' he declared; and the grande dame <i>de
      par la monde</i> made a virtue of necessity, and submitted. In her own
      entertainments, however, she seems to have been as despotic as Nash,
      insisting that people should come early and leave early, and declining to
      provide the profuse refreshments then expected. High-spirited and
      whimsical no doubt she was; but the stories told of her are probably
      exaggerated. Those who praise her, praise her unreservedly. Her character
      was unblemished. She was truthful; she was honest; she was not a
      flatterer. And she was certainly fearless, for she dared, even in the
      rudimentary epoch of the two-pronged fork, to rally the terrible Dean of
      St. Patrick's for that deplorable habit&mdash;so justly deprecated by the
      Historian of Snobs&mdash;of putting his knife in his mouth. When she saw
      any one 'administer the cold steel,' as Thackeray calls it, she would
      shriek out in affected terror lest they should do themselves a mischief.
      She seems, although they never really met after her girlhood, to have
      wholly subjugated Swift, whose final tone to her comes perilously close to
      that fulsome adulation which, in others, stirred his fiercest scorn. 'I
      will excuse your blots upon paper,' he says, writing to her after Gay
      death, 'because they are the only blots you ever did, or ever will make,
      in the whole course of your life.' Further on he refers 'to the universal,
      almost idolatrous esteem you have forced from every person in two
      kingdoms, who have the least regard for virtue.' It is her peculiar art,
      he tells her again, to bribe 'all wise and good men to be her flatterers.'
      Swift was no paragon; but the praise of Swift outweighs the sneers of
      Walpole.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the friend of men of letters&mdash;this capricious great lady, and
      they have judged her best. To Swift in particular it was an attraction
      that she loved and befriended his favourite Gay. The earlier part of the
      brief correspondence from which the above quotation is borrowed, shows the
      Duchess in her most amiable light; and it was with Gay that it originated.
      From the days of her marriage she had protected and petted that fat and
      feckless fabulist; she had championed him in the matter of his second
      ballad-opera in such a way as to procure her own exile from Court; and at
      the time she began to write to Swift, Gay was domiciled at the Duke's
      country house at Ambresbury, or Amesbury, near Salisbury, in Wiltshire.
      Gay begins by sending Swift the Duchess's 'services,' and by wishing on
      his own account that Swift could come to England,&mdash;could come to
      Amesbury. Swift replies with conventional acknowledgment of the civility
      of the lady, whom he had not seen since she was a girl. He hears an ill
      thing of her, he says'&mdash;that she is <i>matre pulchrâ filia pulchrior</i>,
      and he would be angry she should excel her mother (Jane Leveson Gower),
      who, of old, had long been his 'principal goddess.' In the letter that
      succeeds, the Duchess herself adds a postscript to confirm Gay's
      invitation. 'I would fain have you come,' she writes. 'I can't say you'll
      be welcome; for I don't know you, and perhaps I shall not like you; but if
      I do not (unless you are a very vain person), you shall know my thoughts
      as soon as I do myself.' No mode of address could have suited Swift's
      humour better; and part of his next epistle to Gay replies to her
      challenge in the true Swiftian style. He begins very low down on the page&mdash;'as
      a mark of respect, like receiving her Grace at the bottom of the stairs.'
      He goes on with a protest for form's sake against the imperious manner of
      her advances; but he argues ingeniously that she must like him, since they
      are both unpopular with the Queen. If he comes, 'he will,' he adds, 'out
      of fear and prudence, appear as vain as he can, that he may not know her
      thoughts of him.' His closing sentences are in Malvolio's manner. 'This is
      your own direction, but it was needless. For Diogenes himself would be
      vain, to have received the honour of being one moment of his life in the
      thoughts of your grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, <i>les épées s'engagent</i>. As to the correspondence that
      ensued, opinions differ widely. Warton discovered 'exquisite humour and
      pleasantry' in Swift's 'affected bluntness,' and compares him to Voiture,&mdash;to
      Waller writing to Sacharissa on her marriage. Later editors are less
      enthusiastic, regarding the whole series of letters as 'empty, laboured,
      and childish on both sides.' Each of these verdicts is extreme. Swift
      tempering candour by compliment, is an unusual but not an impossible
      spectacle; while the Duchess writes exactly as one would expect her to
      write with Swift's fast friend at her elbow. Gay, knowing that she will
      probably follow him, warns Swift playfully that she has her antipathies,&mdash;that
      she likes her own way,&mdash;that she is very frank, and that in any
      dispute he must be on her side. Thereupon her Grace takes up the pen
      herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Write I must, particularly now, as I have an opportunity to indulge my
      predominant passion of contradiction. I do, in the first place, contradict
      most things Mr. <i>Gay</i> says of me, to deter you from coming here;
      which if you ever do, I hereby assure you, that, unless I like my own way
      better, you shall have yours; and in all disputes you shall convince me if
      you can. But, by what I see of you, this is not a misfortune, that will
      always happen; for I find you are a great mistaker. For example, you take
      prudence for imperiousness:'tis from this first that I determined not to
      like one, who is too giddy-headed for me to be certain whether or no I
      shall ever be acquainted with [him]. I have known people take great
      delight in building castles in the air; but I should choose to build
      friends upon a more solid foundation. I would fain know you; for I often
      hear more good likable things [of you] than 'tis possible any one can
      deserve. Pray, come, that I may find out something wrong; for I, and I
      believe most women, have an inconceivable pleasure to find out any faults,
      except their own. Mr. <i>Cibber</i> is made poet laureate. * I am, Sir, as
      much your humble servant as I can be to any person I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      'C. Q.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      'P.S. Mr. <i>Gay</i> is very peevish that I spell and write ill; but I
      don't care: for neither the pen nor I can do better. Besides, I think you
      have flattered me, and such people ought to be put to trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That this fashion of writing, so new to him, should not have captivated
      Swift, is impossible. He could not accept the invitation; but at least he
      could prolong the correspondence. In his next letter he enters upon
      preliminaries. He is old, dull, peevish, perverse, morose. Has

      she a clear voice?&mdash;and will she let him sit at her left hand, for
      his right ear is the better? Can the parson of the parish play at
      backgammon, and hold his tongue? Has she a good nurse among her women, in
      case he should fancy himself sick? How long will she maintain him and his
      equipage if he comes? A week or two later, in the form of another
      postscript to Gay, follows the reply of the Duchess:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was Mr. <i>Gay's</i> fault that I did not write sooner; which if I
      had, I should hope you would have been here by this time; for I have to
      tell you, all your articles are agreed to; and that I only love my own
      way, when I meet not with others whose ways I like better. I am in great
      hopes that I shall approve of yours; for to tell you the truth, I am at
      present a little tired of my own. I have not a clear or distinct voice,
      except when I am angry; but I am a very good nurse, when people don't
      fancy themselves sick. Mr. <i>Gay</i> knows this; and he knows too how to
      play at backgammon. Whether the parson of the parish can, I know not; but
      if he cannot hold his tongue, I can. Pray set out the first fair wind and
      stay with us as long as ever you please. I cannot name my fixed time, that
      I shall like to maintain you and your equipage; but if I don't happen to
      like you, I know I can so far govern my temper as to endure you for about
      five days. So come away directly; at all hazards you'd be allowed a good
      breathing time. I shall make no sort of respectful conclusions; for till I
      know you, I cannot tell what I am to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the correspondence, always conducted on the one side by Gay and his
      kind protectress, or Gay and the Duke, protracts itself until arrives to
      Swift that fatal missive from Pope and Arbuthnot announcing Gay's sudden
      death,&mdash;a missive which, overmastered by a foreboding of its
      contents, he kept unopened for days. At a later date some further
      communications followed between Swift and the Duchess. But he liked best
      her postscripts to his dead friend's letters. 'They made up,' he told Pope
      unaffectedly, 'a great part of the little happiness I could have here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift survived Gay for nearly fifteen years, and the Duchess lived far
      into the reign of George the Third. In the changing procession of
      Walpole's pages one gets glimpses of her from time to time, generally
      emphasized by some malicious anecdote or epithet. At the coronation she
      returned to Court, appearing with perfectly white hair. Yet, four years
      before her death, Walpole says of her that (by twilight) you would sooner
      'take her for a young beauty of an old-fashioned century than for an
      antiquated goddess of this age.' Indeed her all-conquering charms seduced
      him into panegyric; and one day in 1771, she found these verses on her
      toilet-table, wrung from her most persistent detractor:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'To many a Kitty, Love his car
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Will for a day engage,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But Prior's Kitty, ever fair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Obtained it for an age!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She was then seventy-one. In later life she was often at her seat of
      Drumlanrig, in Dumfriesshire (where she was visited by Mr. Matthew Bramble
      and his party *); and Scott in his 'Journal,' under date of August, 1826,
      speaks of the 'Walk' by the river Nith which she had formed, and which
      still went by her name. Her peculiarities, over which her friend Mrs.
      Delany sighs plaintively, did not abate with age; but her kind heart
      remained. She died in Savile Row in 1777, of a surfeit of cherries, and
      was buried at Durrisdeer.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN, in the year
      1741, after his quarrel with Gray, Horace Walpole lay sick of a quinsy at
      Reggio, the shearing of his thin-spun life was only postponed by the
      opportune intervention of a passing acquaintance. The Rev. Joseph Spence,
      Fellow of New College, Oxford, and Professor of Poetry to that University,
      then travelling in Italy as Governor to Henry Clinton, Earl of Lincoln,
      promptly arrived to his aid, summoned Dr. Cocchi posthaste from Florence,
      and thus became instrumental in enabling the Prince of Letter-Writers to
      expand the thirty or forty epistles he had already produced into that
      magnificent correspondence which, incomplete even now, * fills no fewer
      than nine closely printed volumes.

</pre>
    <p>
      Spence, to whom all Walpole's admirers owe a lasting debt of gratitude,
      was one of the fortunate men of a fortunate literary age. In 1726 he had
      published a 'genteel' critique of Pope's 'Odyssey,' conspicuous for its
      courteous mingling of praise and blame, and not the less grateful to the
      person criticised because&mdash;as Bennot Langton said, and as good luck
      would have it&mdash;ten out of the twelve objections fell, upon the
      labours of Pope's luckless coadjutors, Broome and Fenton. The book made
      Pope his friend, and himself Professor of Poetry, in which capacity he
      patronised Thomson, and protected Queen Caroline's thresher-laureate,
      Stephen Duck. During the continental tours which he undertook in 1730 and
      1737, and in that above referred to, he collected the material for his
      'Polymetis,' a tall <i>folio</i> on classical mythology, the earlier
      editions of which are now chiefly sought after for their irreverent
      vignette of Dr. Cooke, propositor of Eton, in the disguise of 'an ass's
      nowl.' Spence continued to dally lightly with letters, editing Sackville's
      'Gorboduc,' annotating Virgil, writing a life of the blind poet Blacklock,
      and comparing (after the manner of Plutarch), for Walpole's private press
      at Strawberry, Mr. Robert Hill, the 'learned tailor' of Buckingham, with
      that Florentine <i>helluo librorum</i>, Signor Antonio Magliabecchi. He
      lived the mildly studious life of a quiet, easy-going clergyman of the
      eighteenth century, nursing a widowed mother like Pope, and declining to
      disturb the placid ripple of his days by the 'violent delights' of
      matrimony. He is 'the completest scholar,' 'the sweetest tempered
      gentleman breathing,' cries his enthusiastic friend, Mr. Christopher Pitt,
      himself a virtuoso and a translator of Homer. He is 'extremely' polite,
      friendly, cheerful, and master of an infinite fund of subjects for
      agreeable conversation,' says Mr. Shenstone of the Leasowes. 'He was a
      good-natured, harmless little soul, but more like a silver penny than a
      genius,' says ungrateful Mr. Walpole. 'He was a poor creature, though a
      very worthy man,' says clever Mr. Cambridge of the 'World' and the
      'Scribleriad.' To strike an average between these varying estimates is not
      a difficult task. It gives us a character amiable rather than strong,
      finical rather than earnest, well-informed and ingenious rather than
      positively learned. For the rest, 'Polymetis' has been supplanted by
      Lempriere, and is as dead as Stephen Duck; and its author now lives mainly
      by the 'priefs' which, like Sir Hugh Evans, he made in his notebook,&mdash;in
      other words, by the Anecdotes of the Literary Men of his age, which, when
      occasion offered, he jotted down from the conversation of Pope, Young,
      Dean Lockier, and other notabilities into whose company he came from time
      to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Spence's 'Anecdotes' is a chequered one. At their author's
      death they were still in manuscript, though their existence was an open
      secret. Joseph Warton had handselled them for his 'Essay on Pope;' and
      Warburton had used them for Ruffhead's 'Life.' When Spence died in 1768,
      it was discovered that he had himself intended to print them,&mdash;that
      he had, in fact, conditionally sold a selection of them to Robert Dodsley,
      the bookseller (whom he had formerly befriended), for a hundred pounds.
      But before publication was finally arranged both Spence and Robert Dodsley
      died. Spence's executors&mdash;Bishop Lowth, Dr. Ridley, and Mr. Rolle&mdash;thought
      suppression for a time desirable; and the surviving Dodsley, James,
      although, says Joseph Warton, 'he probably would have gained £400 or £500
      by it,' was easily prevailed upon, out of regard for Spence, to relinquish
      the bargain. The manuscript selection was then presented by the executors
      to Spence's old pupil, Lord Lincoln, who had become Duke of Newcastle,
      while the original 'Anecdotes,' and a fair copy, remained in Bishop
      Lowth's possession. The Newcastle MS. was lent to Johnson, who employed it
      for his 'Lives of the Poets,' giving great offence to the Duke by
      acknowledging the loan without mentioning the name of the lender; and
      Malone had access to it for his Dryden, at the same time compiling from it
      a smaller selection, which he annotated briefly. By a series of
      circumstances too lengthy to detail, this last, some years after Malone's
      death, passed into the hands of Mr. John Murray, who published it in 1820.
      In the same year, and, by a curious coincidence, upon the same day,
      appeared another edition based upon the Lowth papers, which had also found
      their way into other hands. This was prefaced and annotated by Mr. S. W.
      Singer, and a second edition of it was issued in 1858 by J. R. Smith.
      Beyond these three editions of the 'Anecdotes,' there has been no other
      reprint but the excellent little compilation in the 'Camelot' series which
      the late Mr. John Underhill put forth in 1890.
    </p>
    <p>
      As will be gathered from the above, Spence's own selection is still
      unpublished, and is supposed to remain in the possession of the Newcastle
      family. But as Malone extracted all of it that he thought worth keeping,
      and as Singer printed the materials on which it was based, it is not
      likely that its publication now, even if it were found to be practicable,
      would be of material interest, except to show what Spence personally
      regarded as deserving of preservation. With respect to the 'Anecdotes'
      themselves, there can be little doubt that, whatever their subsequent
      extension may have been, they originated in Spence's acquaintanceship with
      Pope; and that their first purpose was the bringing together of such
      dispersed data as might serve for the basis of his biography. (So much, in
      fact, Spence told Warburton when they were returning from Twickenham after
      Pope's death; and then, like the courteous, amiable 'silver penny' that he
      was, surrendered all his memoranda to his more pretentious companion, in
      whose subsequent 'Life,' for Ruffhead's 'Life of Pope' is really
      Warburton's, nearly every anecdote of value is derived from Spence.) From
      collecting Popiana to collecting <i>ana</i> of Pope's contemporaries,
      would be a natural step; and it would be but a step farther to add, from
      time to time, such supplementary notes or <i>impressions de voyage</i> as
      presented themselves, even if they had no special connection with the
      primary matter, which is Pope and Pope's doings. Indeed, in Singer's
      opinion, Spence's 'Anecdotes' already contain, not only 'a complete though
      brief autobiography' of the poet, but also 'the most exact record of his
      opinions on important topics,'&mdash;a record which is 'probably the more
      genuine and undisguised, because not premeditated, but elicited by the
      impulse of the moment.' This, as far as it relates to Pope's views on
      abstract literary questions, is no doubt true; but 'genuine,'
      'undisguised,' and 'unpremeditated' are scarcely the epithets which modern
      criticism has taught us to apply to some, at least, of Pope's utterances
      concerning his contemporaries; and in these respects we are more exactly
      informed than the Oxford Professor of Poetry. Take, for instance, the
      well-known Wycherley correspondence. 'People have pitied you extremely,'
      says sympathetic Mr. Spence, who professes to speak <i>verbatim</i>, 'on
      reading your letters to Wycherley [i.e., the correspondence which Pope had
      printed]; surely 'twas a very difficult thing for you to keep well with
      him!' And thereupon Mr. Pope, of Twickenham and Parnassus, replies that
      'it was the most difficult thing in the world;' that he was 'extremely
      plagued up and down, for almost two years,' with Wycherley's verses; that
      Wycherley was really angry at having them so much corrected; that his
      memory was entirely gone,&mdash;and so forth. * All of which Mr. Spence
      confidingly transfers to his tablets. But thanks to the publication by Mr.
      Courthope in 1889, from the manuscripts at Longleat, of most of
      Wycherley's autograph letters, we now know that the correspondence to
      which Spence referred had been considerably 'edited' by Pope with the view
      of misrepresenting his dealings with Wycherley; and there is even
      something more than a suspicion that he actually concocted those of
      Wycherley's letters for which there are no equivalent vouchers in the
      Marquis of Bath's collection.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * He did not tell Spence (as he might have done) that his
     own 'Damn with faint praise' was borrowed from the man he
     was decrying. 'And with faint praises one another damn,' is
     a line in one of Wycherley's prologues.
</pre>
    <p>
      In any case, the real documents show clearly that, instead of resenting
      the amendments and alterations of his 'Deare Little Infallible,' as he
      calls him, the old dramatist received them with effusive gratitude; and,
      far from reproaching the poet for neglecting to visit him (which Pope
      implied), constantly delayed or postponed his own visits to Pope at
      Binfield;&mdash;in short, did, in reality, just the very reverse of what
      he is represented as doing in Pope's garbled correspondence. So that, in
      these worshipful <i>communiqués</i> to Spence, Pope must simply have been
      playing at that eighteenth-century pastime to which Swift refers in the
      'Polite Conversation' as 'Selling a Bargain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pope's life, it is to be feared, there were not a few of these
      equivocal mercantile transactions. He certainly imposed on Spence's
      credulity when he told him that 'there was a design whieh does not
      generally appear,' in other words, a cryptic significance, in his
      correspondence with Henry Cromwell. And he also, with equal certainty,
      disposed of 'a great Pennyworth' (in the current phrase) when he gave him
      the&mdash;from his own point of view&mdash;eminently plausible account of
      the circumstances which led to the notorious character of 'Atti-cus.'
      Whether Spence, who could not be said to be unwarned, since he records
      Addison's caution to Lady Mary against Pope's 'devilish tricks,' had any
      lurking suspicion that Pope was not to be relied upon, does not appear.
      But it is obvious that, without Spence's 'Anecdotes,' Pope's biographers
      would have played but a sorry figure. From Spence it is that we get the
      best account of Pope's precocious early years and studies; of his boyish
      epic of Alcander, Prince of Rhodes, with its under-water scene, and its
      four books of one thousand lines; of the manner of his translation of
      Homer and his plan for the 'Essay on Man;' and of a number of facts
      concerning the trustworthiness of which there can be no reasonable doubt.
      Nor can there be any doubt as to the bulk of his purely critical
      utterances. Many of these, and especially such as deal with individual
      authors, are now become trite and faded. However novel may have been the
      announcement under George the Second, we now learn without a shock of
      surprise that Chaucer is an unequalled taleteller, that Bacon was a great
      genius, that Milton's style is exotic. But, upon his own craft, Pope's
      axioms are still sometimes worth hearing. 'A poem on a slight subject,' he
      says, 'requires the greater care to make it considerable enough to be
      read.' 'After writing a poem one should correct it all over, with one
      single view at a time. Thus, for language: if an elegy, "These lines are
      very good, but are they not of too heroical a strain?" and so <i>vice
      versa</i>' 'There is nothing so foolish as to pretend to be sure of
      knowing a great writer by his style.' '<i>Nil admirari</i> is as true in
      relation to our opinions of authors as it is in morality; and one may say,
      <i>O, admiratores, servum pecus!</i> fully as justly as <i>O, Imitator es!</i>'
      'The great secret how to write well is to know thoroughly what one writes
      about, and not to be affected.' This last, however, is scarcely more than
      an Horatian commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the aid of Spence's 'Anecdotes' we gain admission to the little villa
      by the Thames where, during the spring of 1744, wasted by an intolerable
      asthma, but waiting serenely for the end, Pope lay sinking slowly. Many of
      his sayings, and the sayings of those who visited his sick-room, have
      their only chronicle in this collection. About three weeks before his
      death, he printed his '<i>Ethic Epistles,</i>' copies of which he gave
      away to different persons. 'Here am I, like Socrates,' he told Spence,
      'distributing my morality to my friends, just as I am dying.' On Sunday,
      the 6th of May, he lost his mind for several hours,&mdash;a circumstance
      which sets him wondering 'that there should be such a thing as human
      vanity.' Already his spirit was escaping fitfully to the Unknown. There
      are false colours on the objects about him; he looks at everything 'as
      through a curtain;' he sees 'a vision.' Most of all he suffers from his
      inability to think. But the old love of letters still survives; he quotes
      his own verses; and when in his waking moments Spence reads to him the
      'Daphnis and Chloe' of Longus, he marvels how the infected mind of the
      Regent Orleans can have relished so innocent a book. As to his condition
      he has no illusions. On the 15th, after having been visited by Thompson
      the quack, who had been treating him (as Ward treated Fielding) for
      dropsy, and professed to find him better, he described himself to
      Lyttelton as 'dying of a hundred good symptoms!' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This must have been a commonplace. 'Like the sick man, we
     are just expiring with all sorts of good symptoms,' says
     Swift, in the 'Conduct of the Allies,' 1711.
</pre>
    <p>
      'On every catching and recovery of his mind,' Spence tells us, 'he was
      always saying something kindly either of his present or his absent
      friends'&mdash;'as if his humanity had outlived his understanding.' Many
      of the well-known figures of the day still came and went about his bedside&mdash;Bolingbroke
      from Battersea, tearful and melancholy, full-blown Warburton, Lyttelton
      above-mentioned, Marchmont, blue-eyed Martha Blount; and it was 'very
      observable' how the entry of the lady seemed to give him temporary
      strength, or a new turn of spirits. To the last he continued to struggle
      manfully with his malady. On the 27th, to the dismay of his friends, he
      had himself brought down to the room where they were at dinner; on the
      28th his sedan chair was carried for three hours into the garden he loved
      so well, then filled with the blossoms of May and smelling of the coming
      summer. On the 29th he took the air in Bushey Park, and a little later in
      the day received the sacrament, flinging himself fervently out of bed to
      receive it on his knees. 'There is nothing that is meritorious, he said
      afterwards, 'but virtue and friendship, and indeed friendship itself is
      only a part of virtue.' On the next day, the 30th of May, 1774, he died.
      'They did not know the exact time,' writes the faithful friend to whom we
      owe so many of these 'trivial, fond records,'&mdash;'for his departure was
      so easy that it was imperceptible even to the standers-by.'

    <h2>
      IV. CAPTAIN CORAM'S CHARITY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>MONG a ragged
      regiment of books, very dear to their owner, but in whose dilapidated
      company no reputable volume would greatly care to travel through Coventry,
      is a sheepskin-clad tract entitled 'Mémoires Relating to the State of the
      Royal Navy of England, For Ten Years, Determin'd December 1688.' It dates
      from those antiquated days when even statistics had their air of
      scholarship and their motto from 'Tully' or 'the Antients' (<i>Quid
      Didcius Otio Litterato?</i>&mdash;it is in this case); and the year of
      issue is 1690. The name of the author does not appear, but his portrait by
      Kneller does; and he was none other than the diarist Samuel Pepys,
      sometime Secretary to the Admiralty under the second Charles and his
      successor. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The copy hero described also contains&mdash;but apparently only
     inserted by a former owner&mdash;the scroll book-plate of Pepys.
</pre>
    <p>
      In itself the little volume is an extremely instructive one, as much from
      the light it throws upon the prominent part played by its writer in the
      reconstruction of the Caroline navy, as from its exposure of the
      lamentable mismanagement which permitted toad-stools as big as Mr.
      Secretary's fists to flourish freely in the ill-ventilated holds of his
      Majesty's ships-of-war. But the special attraction of the particular copy
      to which we are referring lies in certain faded inscriptions which it
      contains. On March 14, 1724, it was presented by one 'C. Jackson' to 'Tho.
      Coram,' by whom in turn it was transferred to a Mr. Mills, being
      accompanied by a holograph note which is pasted at the end: 'To Mr Mills
      These Worthy Sir I happend to find among my few Books, Mr Pepys, his
      mémoires [there has evidently been a struggle over the spelling of the
      name], wch I thought might be acceptable to you &amp; therefore pray you
      to accept of it. I am wth much Respect Sir your most humble Scrfc Thomas
      Coram. June 10th, 1746.' It is not a lengthy document, but, with its
      unaffected wording and its simple reference to 'my few Books,' it gives a
      pleasant impression of the brave old mariner to whom, even at the present
      day, so many hapless mortals owe their all; and whose ruddy, kindly face,
      with its curling white hair, still beams on us from Hogarth's canvas at
      the Foundling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Coram must have been seventy-eight years old when he wrote the
      above letter, for he had been born, at Lyme Regis in Dorsetshire, as far
      back as 1668. Of his boyhood nothing is known; but in 1694 he was working
      as a shipwright at Taunton, Massachusetts. His benevolent instincts seem
      to have developed early, for in December, 1703, he conveyed to the Taunton
      authorities some fifty-nine acres of land as the site for a church or
      schoolhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the deed of gift he is described as 'of Boston, in New England,
      sometimes residing in Taunton, in the County of Bristol, Shipwright.' He
      also gave a library to Taunton; and, from the fact that the Common Prayer
      Book used in the church of that town was presented to him for the purpose
      by Mr. Speaker Onslow, must have been successful in enlisting in his good
      offices the sympathies of others. In course of time he became master of a
      ship; and, in 1719, a glimpse of his life, of which there are scant
      details, shows him being plundered and maltreated by wreckers at Cuxhaven,
      while a passenger on a vessel called the 'Sea Flower,' upon which occasion
      the affidavit describes him as 'of London, Mariner and Shipwright.' At
      this date he was engaged in the supply of stores to the navy. He must have
      prospered fairly in his calling, for he soon afterwards retired from a
      sea-faring fife in order to live upon his means, and occupy himself
      entirely with charitable objects. In the Plantations, as they were then
      called, he took great interest; being notably active as regards the
      colonization of Georgia and the improvement of the Nova Scotian cod
      fisheries. Lord Walpole of Wolterton (Horace Walpole's uncle), who had met
      him, testified warmly to his honesty, his disinterestedness, and his
      knowledge of his subject. Neither an educated nor a polished man (and not
      always a judicious one), he was indefatigable in the pursuit of his
      purpose, and his singleminded philanthropy was beyond the shadow of a
      doubt. 'His arguments,' said his intimate friend Dr. Brocklesby, 'were
      nervous, though not nice&mdash;founded commonly upon facts, and the
      consequences that he drew, so closely connected with them, as to need no
      further proof than a fair explanation. When once he made an impression, he
      took care it should not wear out; for he enforced it continually by the
      most pathetic remonstrances. In short, his logic was plain sense; his
      eloquence, the natural language of the heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His crowning enterprise was the obtaining of a charter for the
      establishment of the Foundling Hospital. Going to and fro at Rotherhithe,
      where in his latter days he lived, he was constantly coming upon half-clad
      infants, 'sometimes alive, sometimes dead, and sometimes dying,' who had
      been abandoned by their parents to the mercy of the streets; and he
      determined to devote his energies to the procuring of a public institution
      in which they might find an asylum. For seventeen years, with an
      unconquerable tenacity, and in the face of the most obstinate obstruction,
      apathy, and even contempt, he continued to urge his suit upon the public,
      being at last rewarded by a Royal charter and the subscription of
      sufficient funds to commence operations. An estate of fifty-six acres was
      bought in Lamb's Conduit Fields for £3,500; and the building of the
      Hospital was begun from the plans of Theodore Jacobsen. Among its early
      Governors were many contemporary artists who contributed freely to its
      adornment, thereby, according to the received tradition, sowing the seed
      of the existing Royal Academy. Handel, too, was one of its noblest
      benefactors. For several years he regularly superintended an annual
      performance of the 'Messiah' in the Chapel (an act which produced no less
      than £7,000 to the institution), and he also presented it with an organ.
      Having opened informally in 1741 at a house in Hatton Garden, the
      Governors moved into the new building at the completion of the west wing
      in 1745. But already their good offices had begun to be abused. Consigning
      children to the Foundling was too convenient a way of disposing of them;
      and, even in the Hatton Garden period, the supply had been drawn, not from
      London alone, but from all parts of the Kingdom. It became a lucrative
      trade to convey infants from remote country places to the undiscriminating
      care of the Charity. Once a waggoner brought eight to town, seven of whom
      were dead when they reached their destination. On another occasion a man
      with five in baskets got drunk on the road, and three of his charges were
      suffocated. The inevitable outcome of this was that the Governors speedily
      discovered they were admitting far more inmates than they could possibly
      afford to maintain. They accordingly applied to Parliament, who voted them
      £10,000, but at the same time crippled them with the obligation to receive
      all comers. A basket was forthwith hung at the gate, with the result that
      on the first day of its appearance, no less than 117 infants were
      successively deposited in it. That this extraordinary development of the
      intentions of the projectors could continue to work satisfactorily was of
      course impossible, and great mortality ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, however, a wise restriction prevailed; and the Hospital
      now exists solely for those unmarried mothers whose previous character has
      been good, and whose desire to reform is believed to be sincere.
      Fortunately, long before the era of what one of the accounts calls its
      'frightful efflorescence'&mdash;an efflorescence which, moreover, could
      never have occurred under Captain Coram's original conditions&mdash;its
      benevolent founder had been laid to rest in its precincts. After his
      wife's death he fell into difficulties, and subscriptions were collected
      for his benefit. When this was broken to the old man&mdash;too modest
      himself to plead his own cause, and too proud to parade his necessity&mdash;he
      made, according to Hawkins, the following memorable answer to Dr.
      Brocklesby:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not wasted the little wealth of which I was formerly possessed in
      self-indulgence, or vain expenses, and am not ashamed to confess, that in
      this my old age I am poor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Sunday services are still well attended, Captain Coram's
      Charity is no longer the 'fashionable morning lounge' it was in the
      Georgian era, when, we are told, the grounds were crowded daily with
      brocaded silks, gold-headed canes, and three-cornered hats of the orthodox
      Egham, Staines and Windsor pattern. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Egham, Staines, and Windsor form a triangle. According to
     J. T. Smith, Alderman Boydell was one of the last who wore a
     hat of this type ('Book for a Rainy Day,' 1861, p. 221).
</pre>
    <p>
      No members of the Royal Academy now assemble periodically round the
      historical blue dragon punch-bowl, still religiously preserved, over which
      Hogarth and Lambert and Highmore and the other pictorial patrons of a
      place must often have chirruped 'Life a Bubble,' or 'Drink and Agree,' at
      their annual dinners; neither is there of our day any munificent <i>maestro</i>
      like Handel to present the institution with a new organ or the original
      score of an oratorio. But if you enter to the left of Mr. Calder
      Marshall's statue at the gate in Guildford Street, you shall still find
      the enclosure dotted with red-coated boys playing at cricket, and with
      girls in white caps; and in the quiet, unpretentious building itself are
      many time-honoured relics of its past. Here, for example, is one of
      Hogarth's contributions to his friend's enterprise, the 'March of the
      Guards towards Scotland, in the year 1745,' commonly called the 'March to
      Finchley'&mdash;that famous performance for which King George the Second
      of irate memory said he ought to be 'bicketed,' and which the artist, in a
      rage, forthwith dedicated to the King of <i>Prusia</i>, with one 's.' A
      century and a half has passed since it was executed, but it is still in
      excellent preservation, having of late years, for greater precaution, been
      placed under glass. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was disposed of in 1750 by raffle or lottery.
     'Yesterday,'&mdash;says the 'General Advertiser' for May 1 in
     that year,&mdash;'Mr. Hogarth's subscription was closed. 1843
     chances being subscrib'd for, Mr Hogarth gave the remaining
     107 chances to the Foundling Hospital. At two o'clock the
     Box was opened, and the fortunate chance was No. 1941, which
     belongs to the said Hospital; and the same night Mr Hogarth
     delivered the Picture to the Governors.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Here, too, is the already mentioned full-length of the founder&mdash;a
      portrait of the masterly qualities and superb colouring of which neither
      McArdell's mezzotint nor Nutter's stipple gives any adequate idea. Here,
      again, is one of Hogarth's 'failures,' the 'Moses Brought to Pharaoh's
      Daughter,' which is not so great a failure after all. Certainly it
      compares favourably with the 'Finding of Moses' by the professed
      history-painter, Frank Hayman, which hangs hard by, and is an utterly bald
      and lifeless production. On the contrary, in Hogarth's picture, the
      expression in the eyes of the mother, which linger on the child as her
      hand mechanically receives the money, is one of those touches which make
      the whole world kin. Among the circular paintings of similar charities is
      a charming little Gainsborough of the Charterhouse, while the 'Foundling'
      and 'St. George's Hospital' are from the brush of Richard Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a dignified portrait of Handel by Kneller, which makes one wonder
      how the caricaturists could ever have distorted him into the 'Charming
      Brute;' and also a bust by Roubiliac, being the original model for the
      statues in Westminster Abbey and Old Vauxhall Gardens. There are
      autographs of Hogarth and Coram and John Wilkes the demagogue; there is a
      copy of his 'Christmas Stories' presented by the author, Charles Dickens;
      there is a case in one of the windows full of the queer, forlorn 'marks or
      tokens' which, in the basket days, were found attached to its helpless
      inmates&mdash;ivory fish, silver coins of Queen Anne or James, scraps of
      paper with doggerel rhymes, lockets, lottery tickets, and the like. As you
      pass from the contemplation of these things&mdash;a contemplation not
      without its touch of pathos&mdash;you peep into the church, mentally
      filling the empty benches in the organ loft with the singing faces and
      pure voices of the childish choristers, and you remember that here
      Benjamin West painted the altar-piece, and here Laurence Sterne preached.
      Once more in Guildford Street, you turn instinctively towards another
      thoroughfare, where lived a later writer who must often have made the
      pilgrimage you have just accomplished. For at No. 13 Great Coram Street
      was the home of William Makepeace Thackeray, and from the shadow of the
      Foundling, in July, 1840, he sent forth his 'Paris Sketch Book.' When,
      seven years later, he was writing his greatest novel, Captain Coram's
      Charity still lingered in his memory. It is on the wall of its church that
      old Mr. Osborne, of 'Vanity Fair' and Russell Square, erects his pompous
      tablet to his dead son: it is in the same building that, sitting 'in a
      place whence she could see the head of the boy under his father's
      tombstone,' poor Emmy feasts her hungry maternal eyes on unconscious
      little Georgy.

      V. 'THE FEMALE QUIXOTE.'
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE evening in the
      spring of the year 1751, the famous St. Dunstan, or Devil Tavern, by
      Temple Bar,&mdash;over whose Apollo Chamber you might still read the
      rhymed 'Welcome' of Ben Jonson; whence Steele had scrawled hasty excuses
      to 'Prue' in Bury Street; and where Garth and Swift and Addison had often
      dined together,&mdash;was the scene of a remarkable literary celebration.
      A young married lady, not then so well-known as she afterwards became, had
      written a novel called the 'Life of Harriot Stuart,' which was either just
      published or upon the point of issuing from the press. It was her first
      effort in fiction; and, probably through William Strahan the printer, one
      of whose <i>employés</i> she married, she had sought and obtained the
      acquaintance of Samuel Johnson. The great man thought very highly of her
      abilities: so much so, that he proposed to his colleagues at the Ivy Lane
      Club (the predecessor of the more illustrious Literary Club) to
      commemorate the birth of the book by an 'all-night sitting.' Pompous Mr.
      Hawkins, who tells the story, says that the guests, to the number of near
      twenty, including Mrs. Lenox (for that was the lady's name), her husband,
      and a female acquaintance, assembled at the Devil at about eight o'clock
      in the evening. The supper is characterised as 'elegant,' a prominent
      feature in it being a 'magnificent hot apple-pye,' which, because,
      forsooth (the 'forsooth' is Hawkins's), Mrs. Lenox was also a minor poet,
      her literary foster-father had caused to be stuck with bay-leaves. Besides
      this, after invoking the Muses by certain rites of his own invention,
      which should have been impressive, but are not described, Johnson
      'encircled her brows' with a crown of laurel specially prepared by
      himself. These ceremonies completed, the company began to spend the
      evening 'in pleasant conversation, and harmless mirth, intermingled at
      different periods with the refreshments of coffee and tea.' But there must
      have been stronger potations as well, since the narrator, Hawkins, who had
      a 'raging tooth,' and is therefore excusably inexplicit, speaks of the
      desertion by some of those present of 'the colours of Bacchus;' and he
      expressly mentions the fact that Johnson, whose face, at five o'clock,
      'shone with meridian splendour,' had confined himself exclusively to
      lemonade. By daybreak, the 'harmless mirth' was beginning to be
      intermingled with slumber, from which those who succumbed were only
      rallied with difficulty by a fresh relay of coffee. At length, when St.
      Dunstan's Clock was nearing eight, after waiting two hours for an
      attendant sufficiently wakeful to compile the bill, the company dispersed.
      Their symposium had been Platonic in its innocence; but to Hawkins,
      demoralised by toothache, and sanctimonious by temperament, their issue
      into the morning light of Fleet Street had all the aspect, and something
      of the remorse of a tardily-terminated debauch. Before he could mentally
      disinfect himself, he was obliged to take a turn or two in the Temple, and
      breakfast respectably at a coffee-house.

      Although she is now forgotten, Charlotte Lenox, the heroine of these
      Johnsonian 'high jinks,' was once what Browning would have termed 'a
      person of importance in her day.' Her father, Colonel James Ramsay, was
      Lieutenant-Governor of New York. When his daughter was about fifteen, he
      sent her to England, consigning her to the charge of a relative in this
      country, who, by the time she reached it, was either dead or mad. Then
      Colonel Ramsay himself departed this life, and she was left without a
      protector. Lady Rockingham took her up, receiving her into her household;
      but an obscure love-affair put an end to their connection; and she
      subsequently found a fresh patroness in the Duchess of Newcastle. She must
      also have tried the stage, since Walpole speaks of her as a 'deplorable
      actress.' Her sheet anchor, however, was literature. In 1747 Paterson
      published a thin volume of her poems, dedicated to 'the Lady Issabella
      [sic] Finch,'&mdash;a volume in which she certainly 'touched the tender
      stops of various quills,' since it recalls most of the singers who were
      popular in her time. There are odes in imitation of Sappho (with one 'p');
      there is a pastoral after the manner of Air. Pope; there is 'Envy, a
      Satire; 5 there is a versification of one of Mr. Addison's 'Spectators.5
      To this maiden effort, a few years later, followed the novel
      above-mentioned, which is supposed to have been more or less
      autobiographical; then came another novel, 'The Female Quixote;' then
      'Shakespeare Illustrated;' then a translation of Sully's 'Memoirs;' and
      then again more novels, plays, and translations. Mrs. Lenox lived into the
      present century, supported at the last partly from the Literary Fund, and
      partly by the Right Hon. George Rose, who befriended her in her latter
      days, and ultimately, when she died, old and very poor, in Dean's Yard,
      Westminster, paid the expenses of her burial. She is said&mdash;by Mr.
      Croker, of course&mdash;to have been 'plain in her person.' If this were
      so, she must have been considerably flattered in the portrait by Reynolds
      which Bartolozzi engraved for Harding's 'Shakespeare.' It is also stated,
      on the authority of Mrs. Thrale, that, although her books were admired,
      she herself was disliked. As regards her own sex, this may have been true;
      but it is dead against the evidence as regards the men. Johnson, for
      example, openly preferred her before Mrs. Carter, Miss Hannah More, and
      Miss Burney; and he never, to judge by the references in Boswell's 'Life,'
      wavered in his allegiance. He wrote the Dedications to 'The Female
      Quixote' and 'Shakespeare Illustrated;' he helped her materially (as did
      also Lord Orrery) in her version of Père Brumoy's 'Théâtre des Grecs;' he
      quoted her in the 'Dictionary;' he drew up, as late as 1775, the
      'Proposals' for a complete edition of her works, and he reviewed her
      repeatedly. What is more, he introduced her to Richardson, by whom, upon
      the ground of her gifts and her misfortunes (She 'has genius,' and she
      'has been unhappy,' said the sentimental little man), she was at once
      admitted to the inner circle of the devoted listeners at North End and
      Parson's-Green. Another of her admirers was Fielding, who, in his last
      book, the 'Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon,' calls her 'the inimitable and
      shamefully distress'd author of the Female Quixote.' Finally, Goldsmith
      wrote the epilogue to the unsuccessful comedy of 'The Sister,' which she
      based in 1769 upon her novel of 'Henrietta,'&mdash;an act which is the
      more creditable on his part because the play belonged to the ranks of that
      genteel comedy which he detested. A woman who could thus enlist the
      suffrage and secure the sendee of the four greatest writers of her day
      must have possessed exceptional powers of attraction, either mental or
      physical; and this of itself is almost sufficient to account for the lack
      of a corresponding enthusiasm in her own sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she obtained her education, the scanty records of her life do not
      disclose. But it is clear that she had considerable attainments; and she
      obviously added to them a faculty for ingenious flattery, which, after the
      fashion of that day, she exhibited in her books. In her best effort, 'The
      Female Quixote,' there is a handsome reference to that 'admirable Writer,'
      Mr. Richardson; and Johnson is styled 'the greatest Genius in the present
      Age.' 'Rail,' she makes one of her characters say elsewhere, and painfully
      <i>à-propos de bottes</i>,&mdash;'Rail with premeditated Malice at the
      "Rambler;" and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties
      into Ridicule: The Language, because it reaches to Perfection, may be
      called stiff, laboured, and pedantic; the Criticisms, when they let in
      more light than your weak Judgment can bear, superficial and ostentatious
      Glitter; and because those Papers contain the finest System of Ethics yet
      extant, damn the queer Fellow, for over-propping Virtue;'&mdash;in all of
      which, it is to be feared, the bigots of this iron time will see nothing
      but the rankest logrolling. Yet it was not to Mrs. Lenox that Johnson
      said, 'Madam, consider what your praise is worth.' On the contrary, if Dr.
      Birkbeck Hill conjectures rightly, he wrote a not unfavourable little
      notice of the book in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for March, 1752,&mdash;a
      notice, which, if it does no more, at least compactly summarises the
      scheme of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Arabella,' it says (the full title is 'The Female Quixote; or, the
      Adventures of Arabella'), 'is the daughter of a statesman, born after his
      retirement in disgrace, and educated in solitude, at his castle, in a
      remote province. The romances which she found in the library after her
      mother's death, were almost the only books she had read; from these
      therefore she derived her ideas of life; she believed the business of the
      world to be love, every incident to be the beginning of an adventure, and
      every stranger a knight in disguise. The solemn manner in which she treats
      the most common and trivial occurrences, the romantic expectations she
      forms, and the absurdities which she commits herself, and produces in
      others, afford a most entertaining series of circumstances and events.'
      And then he goes on to quote, as coming from one equally 'emulous of
      Cervantes, and jealous of a rival,' the opinion which Mr. Fielding had
      expressed a few days earlier, in his 'Covent Garden Journal,'&mdash;an
      opinion which, if, as Johnson asserts, he had at this time no knowledge of
      the author of the book, does even more credit to his generosity than to
      his critical judgment. For the author of | Tom Jones' not only devotes
      rather more than two handsome columns to 'The Female Quixote;' but,
      professing to give his report of it 'with no less Sincerity than Candour,'
      gravely proceeds to show in what it falls short of, in what it equals, and
      in what it excels (!) the master-piece of which it is a professed
      imitation. According to him, the advantage of Mrs. Lenox in the last
      respect (for the others may be neglected) lies in the fact that it is more
      probable that the reading of romances would turn the head of a young lady
      than the head of an old gentleman; that the character of Arabella is more
      endearing than that of Don Quixote; that her situation is more
      interesting; and that the incidents of her story, as well as the story
      itself, are less 'extravagant and incredible' than those of the immortal
      hero of Cervantes. Finally, he sums up with the words which Johnson
      afterwards reproduced, in part, in the 'Gentleman's Magazine:' 'I do very
      earnestly recommend it, as a most extraordinary and most excellent
      Performance. It is indeed a Work of true Humour, and cannot fail of giving
      a rational, as well as very pleasing Amusement to a sensible Reader, who
      will at once be instructed and very highly diverted. Some Faults perhaps
      there may be, but these all leave the unpleasing Task of pointing them out
      to those who will have more Pleasure in the Office. This Caution, however,
      I think proper to premise, that no Persons presume to find many [He is
      speaking in his assumed character of Censor of Great Britain]. For if they
      do, I promise them the Critic and not the Author will be to blame.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli</i>. In spite of the verdict
      of Johnson and Fielding,&mdash;that is to say, in spite of the verdict of
      the Macaulay and Thackeray of the Eighteenth Century,&mdash;the Critic, it
      is to be feared, must be blamed to-day. Were Fielding alone, one might
      discount his opinion by assuming that he would naturally welcome a work of
      art which was on his side rather than on that of Richardson; but this
      would not account for the equally favourable opinion of Johnson. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Johnson had, if not a taste, at least an appetite, for the
     old-fashioned romances which Mrs. Lenox satirised. Once, at
     Bishop Percy's, he selected 'Fenxmarte of Hircania' (in
     folio) for his habitual reading, and he read it through
     religiously. Upon another occasion his choice fell upon
     Burke's favourite, 'Palmerin of England.' 'History as She is
     wrote' in 'Clelia' and 'Cleopatra;' the persistence of
     Arabella in finding princes in gardeners, and rescuers in
     highwaymen&mdash;are things not ill-invented. But repeated they
     pall; and not all the insistence upon her natural good sense
     and her personal charms, nor (as compared with such
     concurrent efforts as Mrs. Eliza Haywood's 'Betsy
     Thoughtless')
</pre>
    <p>
      Nor could it be laid entirely to the novelty of the attempt, for 'Tom
      Jones' and 'Clarissa' and 'Peregrine Pickle,' masterpieces all, had by
      this time been written, and can still be read, which it is difficult to
      say of 'The Female Quixote; or, the Adventures of Arabella.' Mrs. Lenox's
      fundamental idea, no doubt, is a good one, although the character of the
      heroine has its feminine prototypes in the 'Précieuses Ridicules' of
      Molière and the Biddy Tipkin of Steele's 'Tender Husband.' It may be
      conceded, too, that some of the manifold complications which arise from
      her bringing every incident of her career to the touchstone of the
      high-falutin' romances of the Sieur de la Calprenède, and that 'grave and
      virtuous virgin,' Madeleine de Scudéry, are diverting enough. The
      lamentable predicament of the lover, Mr. Glanville, who is convicted of
      imperfect application to the pages of 'Cassandra,' by his hopeless
      ignorance of the elementary fact that the Orontes and Oroondates of that
      performance are one and the same person; the case of the luckless dipper
      into Thucydides and Herodotus at Bath who is confronted, to his utter
      discomfiture, with the inoffensive tone of the book itself, can reconcile
      us to a heroine who is unable to pass the sugar-tongs without a reference
      to Parisatis, Princess of Persia, or Cleobuline, Princess of Corinth;&mdash;who
      holds with the illustrious Mandana that, even after ten years of the most
      faithful services and concealed torments, it is still presumptuous for a
      monarch to aspire to her hand;&mdash;and who, upon the slightest
      provocation, plunges into tirades of this sort: 'Had you persevered in
      your Affection, and continued your Pursuit of that Fair-one, you would,
      perhaps, ere this, have found her sleeping under the Shade of a Tree in
      some lone Forest, as <i>Philodaspes</i> did his admirable <i>Delia</i>, or
      disguised in a Slave's Habit, as <i>Ariobarsanes</i> saw his Divine <i>Olympia</i>;
      or bound haply in a Chariot, and have had the Glory of freeing her, as <i>Ambriomer</i>
      did the beauteous <i>Agione</i>; or in a Ship in the Hands of Pirates,
      like the incomparable <i>Eliza</i>; or'&mdash;at which point she is
      fortunately interrupted. In another place she fancies her uncle is in love
      with her, and thereupon, 'wiping some Tears from her fine Eyes,'
      apostrophises that elderly and astounded relative in this wise&mdash;'Go
      then, unfortunate and lamented Uncle; go, and endeavour by Reason and
      Absence to recover thy Repose; and be assured, whenever you can convince
      me you have triumphed over these Sentiments which now cause both our
      Unhappiness, you shall have no Cause to complain of my Conduct towards
      you.' There is an air of unreality about all this, which, one would think,
      should have impeded its popularity in its own day. In the Spain of Don
      Quixote it is conceivable; it is intolerable in the England of Arabella.
      But there are other reasons which help to account for the oblivion into
      which the book has fallen. One is, that by neglecting to preserve the
      atmosphere of the age in which it was written, it has missed an element of
      vitality which is retained even by such fugitive efforts as Coventry's
      'Pompey the Little.' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This, like 'Betsy Thoughtless,' belongs to 1751.
</pre>
    <p>
      Indeed, beyond the above-quoted references to Johnson and Richardson, and
      an obscure allusion to the beautiful Miss Gunnings who, at this date,
      divided the Talk of the Town with the Earthquake, there is scarcely any
      light thrown upon contemporary life and manners throughout the whole of
      Arabella's history. Another, and a graver objection (as one of her
      critics, whose own admirable 'Amelia' had been but recently published,
      should have known better than any one) is that, in spite of the humour of
      some of the situations, the characters of the book are colourless and
      mechanical. Fielding's Captain Booth and his wife, Mrs. Bennet and
      Serjeant Atkinson, Dr. Harrison and Colonel Bath are breathing and moving
      human beings: the Glanvilles and Sir Charleses and Sir Georges of Mrs.
      Charlotte Lenox are little more than shrill-voiced and wire-jointed
      'High-Life' puppets.

    <h2>
      VI. FIELDING'S 'VOYAGE TO LISBON.'
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT far from where
      these lines are written, on the right-hand side of the road from Acton to
      Ealing stands a house called Ford-hook. Shut in by walls, and jealously
      guarded by surrounding trees, it offers itself but furtively to the
      incurious passer-by. Nevertheless, it has traditions which might well give
      him pause. Even in this century, it enjoyed the distinction of belonging
      to Lady Byron, the poet's wife; and in its existing drawing-room, 'Ada,
      sole daughter of my house and heart,' was married to William, Earl of
      Lovelace. But an earlier and graver memory than this lingers about the
      spot. More than one hundred and forty-three years ago, on a certain
      Wednesday in June, the cottage which formerly occupied the site was the
      scene of one of the saddest leave-takings in literature. On this
      particular day had gathered about its door a little group of sympathetic
      friends and relatives, who were evidently assembled to bid sorrowful
      good-bye to some one, for whom, as the clock was striking twelve, a coach
      had just drawn up. Presently a tall man, terribly broken and emaciated,
      but still wearing the marks of dignity and kindliness on his once handsome
      face, made his appearance, and was assisted, with some difficulty (for he
      had practically lost the use of his limbs), into the vehicle. An elderly,
      homely-looking woman, and a slim girl of seventeen or eighteen, took their
      seats beside him without delay; and, amid the mingled tears and good
      wishes of the spectators, the coach drove off swiftly in the direction of
      London. The sick man was Henry Fielding, the famous novelist; his
      companions, his second wife and his eldest daughter. He was dying of a
      complication of diseases; and, like Peterborough and Doddridge before him,
      was setting out in the forlorn hope of finding life and health at Lisbon.
      Since Scott quoted them in 1821, the words in which his journal describes
      his departure have been classic:
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>Wednesday, June</i> 26, 1754.&mdash;On this day, the most melancholy
      sun I had ever beheld arose, and found me awake at my house at Fordhook.
      By the light of this sun, I was, in my own opinion, last to behold and
      take leave of some of those creatures on whom I doated with a mother-like
      fondness, guided by nature and passion, and uncured and unhardened by all
      the doctrine of that philosophical school where I had learnt to bear pains
      and to despise death.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In this situation, as I could not conquer nature, I submitted entirely to
      her, and she made as great a fool of me as she had ever done of any woman
      whatsoever: under pretence of giving me leave to enjoy, she drew me in to
      suffer the company of my little ones, during eight hours; and I doubt not
      whether, in that time, I did not undergo more than in all my distemper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Fielding's life, it may be said truly, that nothing in it became him
      like the leaving it. At the moment of his starting for Lisbon, his case,
      as is clear from the above quotation, was already regarded by himself as
      desperate. To 'a lingering imperfect gout' had succeeded 'a deep
      jaundice;' and to jaundice, asthma and dropsy. He was past the power of
      the Duke of Portland's powder; past the famous tar-water of the good
      Bishop Berkeley. Had he acknowledged his danger earlier, his life might
      have been prolonged, though, in all probability, but for brief space. His
      health had for some time been breaking; he was worn out by his harassing
      vocation as a Middlesex Magistrate; and he feared that, in the event of
      his death, his family must starve. This last consideration it was that
      tempted him to defer his retirement to the country in order to break up a
      notorious gang of street-robbers, and so earn (as he fondly hoped) some
      government provision for those helpless ones whom he must leave behind
      him. He succeeded in his task, although he failed of his reward; and what
      was worse, as regards his health, much irrecoverable opportunity had been
      lost. By the time that his labours were at an end, he was a doomed man.
      The Bath waters could effect nothing in the advanced stage of his malady;
      and, after a short sojourn at his 'little house' at Ealing, he took his
      passage in the 'Queen of Portugal,' Richard Veal, master, for Lisbon. Of
      this voyage he has left his own account; and the posthumous volume thus
      produced is a curiosity of literature. It is one of the most touching
      records in the language of fortitude under trial; and it is not surprising
      to learn&mdash;as we do from Hazlitt&mdash;that it was a favourite book
      with another much-enduring mortal, the gentle and uncomplaining 'Elia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days of steam power, and floating palaces, and luxurious
      sick-room appliances, it is not easy to realize the intolerable tedium and
      discomfort, especially to an invalid, of a passage in a second-rate
      sailing-ship in the middle of the last century. When, after a rapid but
      fatiguing two hours' drive, Fielding reached Redriff (Rotherhithe), he had
      to undergo a further penance. The 'Queen of Portugal' lay in midstream, a
      circumstance which necessitated his being carried perilously across
      slippery ground, transferred to a wherry, and finally hoisted over the
      ship's side in a chair. Nor were his troubles by any means at an end when
      he found himself securely deposited in the cabin. The voyage, already more
      than once deferred, was again postponed. First, the vessel could not be
      cleared at the Custom House until Thursday, because Wednesday was a
      holiday (Proclamation Day); then the skipper himself announced that he
      should not weigh anchor before Saturday. Meanwhile, from his unusual
      exertions and other causes, Fielding's main malady had gained so
      considerably that he was obliged to summon Dr. William Hunter from Covent
      Garden to tap him&mdash;an operation which he had already more than once
      undergone with considerable relief. On Sunday the vessel dropped down to
      Gravesend, reaching the Nore on July 1. Then, for a week, they were
      becalmed in the Downs, making Ryde just in time to lie safely on the
      Motherbank during a violent storm. Before the ship left Ryde, the 23rd of
      July had arrived; and it was not until the second week in August that she
      sailed up the Tagus, having taken seven weeks to perform a journey which
      then, at most, occupied three, and is now generally accomplished in about
      four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the 'Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon' were no more than the chronicle of
      the facts thus summarized&mdash;nay, if it were no more than what Walpole
      flippantly calls the 'account how his [Fielding's] dropsy was treated and
      teased by an innkeeper's wife in the Isle of Wight,' it would require and
      deserve but little consideration. That it is a literary masterpiece is not
      pretended; nor, in the circumstances of its composition, could a
      masterpiece be looked for&mdash;even from a master. But it is interesting
      not so much by the events which it narrates as by the indirect light which
      it throws upon its writer's character, upon his manliness, his patience,
      and that inextinguishable cheerfulness which, he says in the 'Proposal for
      the Poor,' 'was always natural to me.' His sufferings must have been
      considerable (he had to be tapped again before the voyage ended); and yet,
      with the exception of some not resentful comment upon the inhumanity of
      certain watermen and sailors who had jeered at his ghastly appearance, no
      word of complaint as to his own condition is allowed to escape him. On the
      other hand, his solicitude for his fellow-travellers is unmistakable. One
      of the most touching pages in the little volume relates how, when his
      wife, worn out with toothache, lay sleeping lightly in the state room, he
      and the skipper, who was deaf, sat speechless over a 'small bowl of punch'
      in the adjoining cabin rather than run the risk of waking her by a sound.
      'My dear wife and child,' he says, speaking of a storm in the Channel,
      'must pardon me, if what I did not conceive to be any great evil to
      myself, I was not much terrified with the thoughts of happening to them:
      in truth, I have often thought they are both too good, and too gentle, to
      be trusted to the power of any man I know, to whom they could possibly be
      so trusted.' In another place he relates, quite in his best manner, how he
      rebuked a certain churlish Custom-house officer for his want of courtesy
      to Mrs. Fielding. At times one forgets that it is a dying man who is
      writing, so invincible is that appetite for enjoyment which made Lady Mary
      say he ought to have been immortal. Not long after they reached Ryde he
      wrote to his half-brother and successor John (afterwards Sir John)
      Fielding: 'I beg that on the Day you receive this Mrs. Daniel [his
      mother-in-law] may know that we are just risen from Breakfast in <i>Health
      and Spirits</i> [the italics are ours] this twelfth Instant at 9 in the
      morning.' At Ryde they were shamefully entreated by the most sharp-faced
      and tyrannical of landladies, in whose incommodious hostelry they sought
      temporary refuge; and yet it is at Ryde that he chronicles 'the best, the
      pleasantest, and the merriest meal [in a barn], with more appetite, more
      real, solid luxury, and more festivity, than was ever seen in an
      entertainment at White's.' And almost the last lines of the 'Journal'
      recall a good supper in a Lisbon coffee-house for which they 'were as well
      charged, as if the bill had been made on the Bath road, between Newbury
      and London.' But the pleasures of the table play a subordinate part in the
      sick man's diary, and often only prompt a larger subject, as when the John
      Dory which regales them at Torbay introduces a disquisition on the
      improvement of the London fish supply. As might be anticipated, some of
      his best passages deal with the humanity about him. With characteristic
      reticence, he says little of his own companions, but his pen strays easily
      into graphic sketches of the little' world of the 'Queen of Portugal.' The
      ill-conditioned Custom-house officer, already mentioned; the military fop
      who comes to visit the captain at Spithead; the sordid and shrewish Ryde
      landlady with her chuckleheaded nonentity of a husband&mdash;are all
      touched by a hand which, if tremulous, betrays no diminution of its
      cunning. Of all the potraits, however, that of the skipper is the best. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The picture, it should be added, was not at first
     presented in its racy entirety. When, in February, 1755, the
     'Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon' was given to the world for
     the benefit of Fielding's widow and children, although the
     'Dedication to the Public' affirmed the book to be 'as it
     came from the hands of the author,' many of the franker
     touches which go to complete the full-length of Captain
     Richard Veal, as well as sundry other particulars, were
     withheld. This question is fully discussed in the
     Introduction to the limited edition of the 'Journal,'
     published in 1892 by the Chiswick Press.
</pre>
    <p>
      The rough, illiterate, septuagenarian sea-captain, 'full of strange oaths'
      and superstitions, despotic, irascible and good-natured, awkwardly
      gallanting the ladies in all the splendours of a red coat, cockade and
      sword, and heart-broken, privateer though he had been, when his favourite
      kitten is smothered by a feather-bed, has all the elements of a finished
      individuality. It is with respect to him that occurs almost the only
      really dramatic incident of the voyage. A violent dispute having arisen
      about the exclusive right of the passengers to the cabin, Fielding
      resolved, not without misgivings, to quit the ship, ordering a hoy for
      that purpose, and taking care, as became a magistrate, to threaten Captain
      Veal with what that worthy feared more than rock or quicksand, the terrors
      of retributary legal proceedings. The rest may be told in the journalist's
      own words: 'The most distant sound of law thus frightened a man, who had
      often, I am convinced, heard numbers of cannon roar round him with
      intrepidity. Nor did he sooner see the hoy approaching the vessel, than he
      ran down again into the cabin, and, his rage being perfectly subsided, he
      tumbled on his knees, and a little too abjectly implored for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not suffer a brave man and an old man, to remain a moment in this
      posture; but I immediately forgave him.' Most of those who have related
      this anecdote end discreetly at this point. Fielding, however, is too
      honest to allow us to place his forbearance entirely to the credit of his
      magnanimity. 'And here, that I may not be thought the sly trumpeter of my
      own praises, I do utterly disclaim all praise on the occasion. Neither did
      the greatness of my mind dictate, nor the force of my Christianity exact
      this forgiveness. To speak truth, I forgave him from a motive which would
      make men much more forgiving, if they were much wiser than they are;
      because it was convenient for me so to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With the arrival of the 'Queen of Portugal' at Lisbon the 'Journal' ends,
      and no further particulars of its writer are forthcoming. Two months later
      he died in the Portuguese capital, and was buried among the cypresses of
      the beautiful English cemetery. <i>Luget Britannia gremio non dari Fovere
      natum</i>&mdash;is inscribed upon his tomb.

      VII. HANWAY'S TRAVELS.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE hot day in
      Holborn,&mdash;one of those very hot days when, as Mr. Andrew Lang or M.
      Octave Uzanne has said, the brown backs buckle in the fourpenny boxes, and
      you might poach an egg on the cover of a quarto,&mdash;the incorrigible
      bookhunter who pens these pages purchased two octavo volumes of 'Beauties
      of the Spectators, Tatlers and Guardians, Connected and Digested under
      Alphabetical Heads.' That their contents were their main attraction would
      be too much to say. For the literary 'Beauties' of one age, like those

    </p>

      are not always the 'Beauties' of another. Where the selector of to-day
      would put Sir Roger de Coverley and Will Wimble, the Everlasting Club, or
      the Exercise of the Fan, the judicious gentlemen in rusty wigs and inked
      ruffles who managed the 'connecting' and 'digesting' department for
      Messrs. Tonson in the Strand, put passages on Detraction, Astronomy,
      Chearful-ness (with an 'a'), Bankruptcy, Self-Denial, Celibacy, and the
      Bills of Mortality. They must have done a certain violence to their
      critical convictions by including, in forlorn isolation, such flights of
      imagination as the 'Inkle and Yarico' of Mr. Steele and the 'Hilpah and
      Shalum' of Mr. Addison. The interest of this particular copy is, however,
      peculiar to itself. It is bound neatly in full mottled calf, with stamped
      gold roses at the corners of the covers; and at the points of a star in
      the centre are printed the letters E, G, C, G. An autograph inscription in
      the first volume explains this mystery. They are the initials of the 'Twin
      Sisters
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth, &amp; Miss Caroline Grigg,' to whom are addressed the
      votive couplets that follow:&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After this comes&mdash;'Thus prays Your very true friend &amp;
      affectionate Servant J. Hanway,'&mdash;a signature which proves that one
      may be a praiseworthy philanthropist and a copious Pamphleteer and yet
      write no better verse than the Bellman. For without consulting the records
      at the Marine Society in Bishopsgate Street, there is little doubt that
      the writer of these lines was the once well-known Jonas Hanway of the
      Ragged Schools, the Magdalen Hospital, and half a hundred other benevolent
      undertakings. Indeed the circumstance that the book is addressed to <i>two</i>
      ladies is, of itself, almost proof of this, since, either from bachelor
      caution, or from some other obscure cause, Hanway always attaches a
      Dingley to his Stella. His 'Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston' is
      addressed to two ladies; so also is his famous 'Essay on Tea.' But there
      is stronger confirmation still. He was in the habit of giving away copies
      of this very book&mdash;in fact of this very edition&mdash;as presents to
      his friends and <i>protégés</i>. Not long ago, in a second-hand
      bookseller's catalogue, was advertised another pair of the same volumes,
      in 'old English red morocco, elaborately tooled,' which had been given by
      Hanway to his 'young friend Master John Thomson.' It was dated from Red
      Lion Square in 1772, the same year in which his verses to the Demoiselles
      Grigg were written. Master Thomson's initials were also impressed upon the
      sides of this copy; and although the Muses had not been invoked in his
      behalf, the book contained a holograph letter of nine pages of useful
      advice, by the aid of which, coupled with the 'Beauties,' he was to learn
      'to attain the treasures of health, wealth, peace, and happiness.' But
      from the excellent condition of the volumes in both instances, it must be
      inferred that neither of the twin sisters nor Mr. Hanway's 'young friend'
      acted upon Johnson's precept and gave their days and nights to the periods
      of Addison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Hanway himself, Johnson said, in his memorable way, 'that he acquired
      some reputation by travelling abroad, but lost it all by travelling at
      home.' His 'Historical Account of the British Trade on the Caspian Sea'
      (generally called 'Travels in Persia'), 1753, 4 vols., quarto, did indeed
      once enjoy a considerable reputation, and his adventures were adventurous
      enough. Beginning life as a Lisbon merchant, he subsequently accepted a
      partnership in a St. Petersburgh house. At this date the Russo-Persian
      trade had recently been established by Captain John Elton, who afterwards,
      to the disgust of the St. Petersburgh factors, took service under Nadir
      Shah. Hanway accompanied a caravan of woollen goods to Persia; and here
      began his experiences. He found Astrabad in rebellion, and the caravan was
      plundered. Thereupon, after many privations and narrow escapes, he made
      his way to Nadir Shah, who ordered restitution of the goods,&mdash;a
      restitution which was more easy to order than to execute, although
      something was restored. But the traveller's troubles were by no means at
      an end. In the Caspian, on the return voyage, his ship was attacked by the
      Ogurtjoy pirates, and he himself afterwards fell seriously ill. To this
      succeeded, in consequence of the presence of plague at Cashan, the
      amenities of a long quarantine on an island in the Volga, in the final
      stage of which the unhappy travellers 'were required to strip themselves
      entirely naked in the open air [this was in a Russian October], and go
      through the unpleasant ceremony of having each a large pail of warm water
      thrown over them, before they were permitted to depart.' Alien Hanway at
      last reached Moscow, he found that the opportune death of a relative had
      placed him in possession 'of pecuniary advantages, much exceeding any he
      could expect from his engagement in Caspian affairs.' He nevertheless
      stayed five years and a half more at St. Petersburgh; and then, returning
      to England, took up his abode in London, where he proceeded to prepare his
      travels for the press. Being laudably unwilling that any publisher should
      run the risk of losing money by him, the first edition was printed at his
      own expense; but the book proved a great success, passing speedily into
      many libraries (into Gray's among others), and Andrew Millar ultimately
      purchased the copyright. The remainder of Hanway's life was spent in
      philanthropy and pamphleteering. He helped Sir John Fielding and others to
      set on foot the still existent Marine Society for training boys for the
      sea; he helped to remodel 'Captain Coram's Charity,' of which he was a
      Governor; he founded the Magdalen Hospital; he advocated the interests of
      Sunday-Schools and Ragged Schools, of chimney-sweeps and the infant poor.
      Not the least important of his services to the community was his
      vindication, in the teeth of the chairmen and hackney coachmen, of the
      use, by men, of the umbrella, hitherto confined to the weaker sex. * As a
      pamphleteer he was unwearied, and the mere titles of his efforts in this
      way occupy four columns of Messrs. Stephen and Lee's great dictionary. He
      wrote on the Naturalization of the Jews; he wrote on Vails-Giving, on the
      American War, on Pure Bread, on Solitary

      Confinement; he wrote 'Earnest Advice' and 'Moral Reflections' to
      Everybody on Everything. To misuse Ben Jonson's words of Shakespeare, 'He
      flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be
      stopped.' One entire pamphlet on bread was dictated in the space of a
      forenoon, says his secretary and biographer Pugh. When it is further
      explained that it consisted of two hundred law sheets, or ninety octavo
      pages, it is obvious that the excellent author's powers as a pamphleteer
      must have been preternatural. But it is hardly surprising to find even his
      admirer admitting that his ideas were not well arranged, and that his
      style was undeniably diffuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter quality is aptly illustrated by a volume which lies before us,
      being in fact the identical record of those travels in England by which
      Johnson asserted that Mr. Hanway had lost the celebrity he had acquired by
      his 'Travels in Persia.' The very title of the book&mdash;a privately
      printed quarto&mdash;is as long as that of 'Pamela.' It runs thus,&mdash;'A
      Journal of Eight Days Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston upon Thames;
      through South-am ton, Wiltshire, etc. With Miscellaneous Thoughts, Moral
      and Religious; in a Series of Sixty-four Letters: Addressed to two Ladies
      of the Partie. To which is added, An Essay on tea, considered as
      'pernicious to Health, obstructing Industry, and impoverishing the Nation:
      With an Account of its Growth, and great Consumption in these Kingdoms.
      With several political Reflections; and Thoughts on Public Love. In
      Twenty-five Letters to the same Ladies. By a Gentleman of the Partie.
      London: H. Woodfall, 1756.' The 'Partie,' by the way, if we are to trust
      Wale's emblematic frontispiece, must have been limited to the writer and
      these two ladies, discreetly disguised in the 'Contents' as 'Mrs. D.' and
      'Mrs. O.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, as remarked by an ingenious 'Monthly Reviewer,' it should be
      necessary to tell 'Mrs. D.' and 'Mrs. O.' (whom the artist shows us
      conversing agreeably with Mr. Hanway under an awning in a two-oared boat)
      what, having been of the 'Partie,' they probably knew quite as well as he
      did, is not explained. But on the other hand, it may be contended that he
      really tells them very little, since the 'Moral and Religious' reflections
      almost entirely swallow up the Travels. 'On every occurrence,' says the
      critic quoted, 'he expatiates, and indulges in reflection. The appearance
      of an inn upon the road suggests... an eulogium on temperance; the
      confusion of a disappointed Landlady gives rise to a Letter on Resentment;
      and the view of a company of soldiers furnishes out materials for an Essay
      on War.' The company of soldiers was Lord George Bentinck's regiment of
      infantry on their march to Essex; and one sighs to think with what a
      bustle of full-blooded humanity&mdash;what a 'March to Finchley' of
      incident&mdash;the author of a 'Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon' would have
      filled the storied page. But Mr. Hanway is not the least penitent; rather
      is he proud of his reticence. He specially expresses his gratitude to the
      hostess 'who gave occasion for my thoughts on resentment, a subject far
      more interesting than whether a battle was fought at this, or any other
      place, five hundred years ago.' (If 'Mrs. D.' and 'Mrs. O.' were really of
      this opinion, they must have been curiously constituted.) 'Can you bear
      with this medley of both worlds?' he asks them on another occasion, and it
      is not easy to reply except by saying that there is too much of one and
      too little of the other. To pass Bevis Mount with the barest mention of
      Lord Peterborough; to come to Amesbury and 'Prior's Kitty' and be fobbed
      off with 'a pious rhapsody;' to stop at Stockbridge for which Steele was
      member when he was expelled from Parliament, only to enter upon fifty
      pages of indiscriminate reflections on Public Love, Self-examination, the
      Vanity of Life, and half a dozen other instructive but irrelevant
      subjects,&mdash;these things, indeed, are hard to bear, especially as they
      are not recommended by any particular distinction of matter or manner.
      'Tho' his opinions are generally true,' says the critic already quoted,
      'and his regard for virtue seems very sincere, yet these alone are not, at
      this day, sufficient to defend the cause of truth; stile, elegance, and
      all the allurements of good writing, must be called in aid: especially if
      the age be in reality, as it is represented by this Author, averse to
      everything that <i>but seems</i> to be serious.' 'Novelty of thought,' he
      says again, 'and elegance of expression, are what we chiefly require, in
      treating on topics with which the public are already acquainted: but the
      art of placing trite materials in new and striking lights, cannot be
      reckoned among the excellencies of this Gentleman; who generally enforces
      his opinions by arguments rather obvious than new, and that convey more
      conviction than pleasure to the Reader.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, with the book before us, we should borrow from an anonymous writer in
      the 'Monthly Review,' requires a word of explanation. The reviewer was
      Oliver Goldsmith, at this time an unknown scribbler, working as 'general
      utility man' to Mr. Ralph Griffiths the bookseller, who owned the
      magazine. Goldsmith devotes most of his notice to the 'Essay on Tea,' the
      scope of which is sufficiently indicated by its title. But the 'Essay on
      Tea' also engaged the attention of a better known though not greater
      critic, Samuel Johnson, whose 'corruption was raised' (as the Scotch say)
      by this bulky if not weighty indictment of his darling beverage. Johnson's
      critique was in the 'Literary Magazine.' At the outset he makes candid and
      characteristic profession of faith. 'He is,' he says, 'a hardened and
      shameless Tea-drinker, who has for twenty years diluted his meals with
      only the infusion of this fascinating plant, whose kettle has scarcely
      time to cool, who with Tea amuses the evening, with Tea solaces the
      midnight, and with Tea welcomes the morning.' The arguments on either side
      are now of little moment, though Hanway, as a merchant, is better worth
      hearing on the commercial aspect of the Tea question than on things in
      general. But the review greatly irritated him. An unfortunate remark
      dropped by Johnson about the religious education of the children in the
      Foundling stung him into an angry retort in the 'Gazetteer,'&mdash;a
      retort to which (according to Boswell) Johnson made the only rejoinder he
      is ever known to have offered to anything that was written against him. As
      may be expected, it was not a document from which his opponent could
      extract much personal gratification; but it is not otherwise remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the criticism of Johnson and Goldsmith was not wholly undeserved
      must, it is feared, be conceded. Even in days less book-burdened, and more
      patient of tedium than our own, to string half a dozen pamphlets of
      platitudes upon the slenderest of threads, and call it the 'Journal of a
      Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston-upon-Thames,' could scarcely have been
      tolerable. Yet Johnson allowed to the author the 'merit of meaning well.'
      Hanway's benevolence was, in truth, unquestioned. His sincerity was beyond
      suspicion, and his services to his fellow-creatures were considerable. His
      misfortune was that, like many excellent persons, his sense of humour was
      imperfect, and his infirmity of digression chronic. He was, moreover, the
      victim of the common delusion that to teach and to preach are
      interchangeable terms. His biographer Pugh, who admits that, with all his
      good qualities, he had a 'certain singularity of thought and manners,'
      gives some curious details as to his habits and costume. In order to be
      always ready for polite society, he usually appeared in dress clothes,
      including a large French bag (which duly figures in Wale's frontispiece)
      and a <i>chapeau bras</i> with a gold button. 'When it rained, a small <i>parapluie</i>
      defended his face and wig.' His customary garb was a suit of rich dark
      brown, lined with ermine, to which he added a small gold-hilted sword. He
      was extremely susceptible to cold, and habitually wore three pairs of
      stockings. He was an active pedestrian, although he possessed an equipage
      called a 'solo' (which we take to be the equivalent of Sterne's <i>Désobligeante</i>).
      Among his other characteristics was the embellishment of his house in Red
      Lion Square in such a way as to prompt and promote improving conversation
      in those unhappy intermissions of talk which come about while the
      card-tables are being set, and so forth. The decorations in the
      drawing-room were not without a certain mildly-moral ingenuity. They
      consisted of portraits of Adrienne Le Couvreur and five other famous
      beauties, in frames united by a carved and gilded ribbon inscribed with
      passages in praise of beauty. Above these was placed a statue of Humility;
      below, a mirror just convex enough to reduce the female spectator to the
      scale of the portraits, and round the frame of this was painted,&mdash;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT very far from
      'streaming London's central roar'&mdash;or, in plain words, about midway
      in Fleet Street, on the left-hand side as you go toward Ludgate Hill&mdash;is
      a high and narrow archway or passage over which is painted in dingy
      letters the words 'Bolt Court.' To the lover of the 'Great Cham of
      Literature,' the name comes freighted with memories. More than a hundred
      years ago 'the ponderous mass of Johnson's form,' to quote a poem by Mrs.
      Barbauld, must often have darkened that contracted approach, when, in
      order to greet with tea the coming day ('veniente die'), * and to postpone
      if possible that 'unseasonable hour at which he had habituated himself to
      expect the oblivion of repose,' he rolled across from the Temple to Miss
      Williams's rooms. Where the blind lady lodged, no Society of Arts tablet
      now reveals to us; but as soon as the pilgrim has traversed the dark and
      greasy entrance-way, and finds himself in the little court itself, with
      its disorderly huddle of buildings, and confusion of tip-cat playing
      children, he is in Johnson's land, and only a few steps from the actual
      spot on which Johnson's last hours were spent. Fronting him, in the
      farther angle of the enclosure, is the Stationers' Company's School, and
      the Stationers' Company's School stands upon the site of No. 8 Bolt Court,
      formerly Bensley's Printing Office, ** but earlier still the last
      residence of Dr. Johnson, who lived in it from 1776 to 1784.

     During Bensley's tenancy of the house it was twice the scene
     of disastrous fires, by the second of which (in June, 1819)
     the Doctor's old rooms were entirely destroyed. Among other
     valuables burned at Bensley's was the large wood block
     engraved by Bewick's pupil, Luke Clennell, for the diploma
     of the Highland Society; and the same artist's cuts after
     Stothard for Rogers's 'Pleasures of Memory' of 1810 were
     only saved from a like fate by being kept in a 'ponderous
     iron chest.'

      It was in the backroom of its first floor that, on Monday, the 13th
      December in the latter year, at about seven o'clock in the evening, his
      black servant Francis Barber and his friend Mrs. Desmoulins, who watched
      in the sick-chamber, 'observing that the noise he made in breathing had
      ceased, went to the bed, and found that he was dead.'

      Standing in Bolt Court to-day, before the unimposing façade of the school
      which now occupies the spot, it is not easy to reconstruct that quiet
      parting-scene; nor is it easy to realize the old book-burdened upper
      floors, or the lower reception chamber, where, according to Sir John
      Hawkins, were given those 'not inelegant dinners' of the good Doctor's
      more opulent later years. Least of all is it possible to conceive that,
      somewhere in this pell-mell of bricks and mortar, was once a garden which
      the famous Lexicographer took pleasure in watering; and where, moreover,
      grew a vine from which, only a few months before he died, he gathered
      'three bunches of grapes.' But if Bolt Court prove unstimulating, you have
      only to take a few steps to the right, and you arrive, somewhat
      unexpectedly, in a little parallelogram at the back, known as Gough
      Square. Here, in the north-west corner, still stands one of the last of
      those sixteen residences in which Johnson lived in London. It is at
      present a place of business; but the tenants make no difficulty about your
      examination of it, and when you inquire for the well-known garret you are
      at once invited to inspect it. The interior of the house, of course, is
      much altered, but there is still a huge chain at the front door, which
      dates from Johnson's day, and the old oak-balustraded staircase remains
      intact. As you climb its narrow stages, you remember that, sixty years
      since, Thomas Carlyle must have made that ascent before you; * and you
      wonder how Johnson, with his bad sight and his rolling gait, managed to
      steer up it at all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * He visited it in 1831 (Froude's 'Carlyle,' vol. ii., eh.
     x.).
</pre>
    <p>
      The flight ends in the garret itself, upon which you emerge at present, as
      in a hay-loft. But it is not in the least such a 'sky-parlour' as Hogarth
      assigns to his 'Distressed Poet.' It occupies the whole width and breadth
      of the building; it is sufficiently lighted by three windows in front, and
      two dormers at the sides; and the pitch of the roof is by no means low.
      Here you are actually in Johnson's house; and as you turn to look at the
      stairway you have just quitted, it is odds if you do not expect to see the
      shrivelled wig, the seared, blinking face, and the heavy shoulders of the
      Doctor himself rising slowly above the aperture with a huge volume under
      his arm. For it was in this very garret in Gough Square, within sound of
      the hammers of that famous clock of St. Dunstan's, to which Cowper refers
      in the 'Connoisseur,' * that the great Dictionary was compiled.
    </p>

      Here laboured Shiels, the amanuensis, and his five companions, ceaselessly
      transcribing the passages which had been marked for them to copy, and
      probably going 'odd man or plain Newmarket' for beer as soon as ever their
      employer's back was turned; here, also, at the little fire-place in the
      corner, must often have sat Johnson himself, peering closely (much as
      Reynolds shows him in the portrait of 1778) at the proofs that were going
      to long-suffering Andrew Millar. It was in this identical garret that
      Joseph Warton once visited him to pay a subscription; here came Roubiliac
      and Sir Joshua; and here, when the room had grown to be dignified by the
      title of the 'library,' Johnson received Dr. Burney, who found in it 'five
      or six Greek folios, a deal writing-desk, and a chair and a half.' The
      half-chair must have been that mentioned by Miss Reynolds; and it is
      evident that long experience or repeated misadventure had made Johnson
      both skilful and cautious in manipulating it. 'A gentleman,' she says,
      'who frequently visited him whilst writing his "Idlers" [the 'Idler' was
      partly composed in Gough Square in 1758] constantly found him at his desk,
      sitting on a chair with three legs; and on rising from it, he remarked
      that Dr. Johnson never forgot its defect, but would either hold it in his
      hand or place it with great composure against some support, taking no
      notice of its imperfection to his visitor.' 'It was remarkable in Dr.
      Johnson,' she goes on, 'that no external circumstances ever prompted him
      to make any apology, or to seem even sensible of their existence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gough Square Johnson lived from 1749 to 1759. 'I have this day moved my
      things,' he writes to his step-daughter, Miss Porter, on the 23rd of March
      in the latter year, 'and you are now to direct to me at Staple Inn.' These
      ten years were among the busiest and most productive of his life. No
      pension had as yet made existence easier to him; no Boswell was at hand to
      seduce him to port and the Mitre; and the Literary Club, as yet unborn,
      existed only in embryo at a beefsteak shop in Ivy Lane. Besides the
      'Idler' and the Dictionary, which latter was published in the middle of
      his sojourn at Gough Square, he sent forth from his garret 'Irene' and the
      'Vanity of Human Wishes,' the 'Rambler,' and the essays in Hawkesworth's
      'Adventurer.' It was here that he drew up those proposals for that belated
      edition of Shakespeare of which Churchill said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He for Subscribers baits his hook,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And takes their cash&mdash;but where's the Book?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and here, early in 1759, he wrote his 'Rasselas.' It was in Gough Square,
      on the 16th of March, 1756, that he was arrested for £5 18s., and only
      released by a prompt loan from Samuel Richardson; it was while living in
      Gough Scpiare that he penned that noble letter to Chesterfield, of which
      Time seems to intensify rather than to attenuate the manly dignity and the
      independent accent. 'Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with
      unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has
      reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been
      pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it
      has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am
      solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I
      hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no
      benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the Publick should
      consider me as owing that to a Patron which Providence has enabled me to
      do for myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Till I am solitary, and cannot impart it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thought recurs in the closing words of the preface to his <i>magnum
      opus</i>, which, little more than two months after the date of the above
      letter, appeared in a pair of folio volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have protracted my work till most of those whom I wished to please have
      sunk into the grave; and success and miscarriage are empty sounds.' It
      needs no Boswell to tell us that the reference here is to the death, three
      years before, of his wife,&mdash;that fantastic 'Tetty,' to himself so
      beautiful, to his friends so unattractive, whom he loved so ardently and
      so faithfully, and whose name, coupled with so many 'pious breathings,' is
      so frequently to be found in his 'Prayers and Meditations.' 'This is the
      day,' he wrote, thirty years afterwards, 'on which, in 1752, dear Tetty
      died. I have now uttered a prayer of repentance and contrition; perhaps
      Tetty knows that I prayed for her. Perhaps Tetty is now praying for me.
      God help me.' In her epitaph at Bromley he styles her '<i>formosa, culta,
      ingeniosa, pia</i>.' In a recently discovered letter she is his 'charming
      Love,' his 'most amiable woman in the world,' and (even at fifty) his
      'dear Girl.' He preserved her wedding ring, says Boswell, 'as long as he
      lived, with an affectionate care, in a little round wooden box, in the
      inside of which he pasted a slip of paper, thus inscribed by him in fair
      characters, as follows: '<i>Eheu! Eliz. Johnson, Nuptay Jul. 9° 1736,
      Mortua, eheu! Mart.</i> 17° 1752.' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This ring was exhibited at the Guelph Exhibition of 1891
     by Mr. A. C. Lomax.
</pre>
    <p>
      Her loss was not the only bereavement he suffered in Gough Square. Two
      months before he left it, in 1759, his mother died at Lichfield,&mdash;'one
      of the few calamities,' he had told Lucy Porter, 'on which he thought with
      terror.' Confined to London by his work, he was not able to close her
      eyes; but he wrote to her a last letter almost too sacred in its wording
      for the profanation of type, and he consecrated an 'Idler' to her memory.
      'The last year, the last day, must come,' he says mournfully. 'It has
      come, and is past. The life which made my own life pleasant is at an end,
      and the gates of death are shut upon my prospects.' To pay his mother's
      modest debts, and to cover the expenses of her funeral, he penned his sole
      approach to a work of fiction,&mdash;the story of 'Rasselas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who now reads Johnson? If he pleases still,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Tis most for Dormitive or Sleeping Pill,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      one might say, in not inappropriate parody of Pope. His strong
      individuality, his intellectual authority, his conversational power, must
      live for ever; but his books!&mdash;who, outside the fanatics of
      literature,&mdash;who reads them now? Macaulay, we are told by Lord
      Houghton, once quoted 'London' at a dinner-table, but then he was talking
      to Dean Milman; and Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his novel of 'A Mortal
      Antipathy,' refers to the Prince of Abyssinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browning, says Mrs. Sutherland Orr, qualified himself for poetry in his
      youth by a diligent perusal of the Dictionary; and it may perhaps be said
      of him, in those words of Horace which Johnson himself applied to Prior,
      that 'the vessel long retained the scent which it first received.' But who
      now, among the supporters of the circulating libraries, ever gets out the
      'Rambler,' or 'Irene,' or the 'Vanity of Human Wishes' (beloved of Scott
      and Byron), or 'Rasselas,'&mdash;'Rasselas,' once more popular than the
      'Vicar of Wakefield,' *&mdash;'Rasselas,' which despite such truisms as
      'What cannot be repaired is not to be regretted,' is full of sagacious
      'criticism of life'!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Of an illustrated edition of the' Vicar' published at the
     end or 1890, we are credibly informed that 8,000 copies were
     sold within a twelvemonth. And where is 'Rasselas' now?
</pre>
    <p>
      The honest answer must be, 'Very few.' Yet a day may come when the
      Johnsonese of Johnson's imitators will be forgotten, and people will turn
      once more to the fountain-head to find, with surprise, that it is not so
      polluted with Latinisms after all, and that it abounds in passages direct
      and forcible. 'Of all the writings which are models,' says Professor
      Earle, 'models I mean in the highest sense of the word, models from which
      the spirit of genuine true and wholesome diction is to be imbibed (not
      models of mannerism of which the trick or fashion is to be caught), I have
      no hesitation in saying that there is one author unapproachably and
      incomparably the best, and that is Samuel Johnson.' And this is the
      'deliberate conclusion' of an expert who has given almost a lifetime to
      the comparative study of English prose.

    <h2>
      IX. HOGARTH'S SIGISMUNDA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>OWARD the close of
      the last century, the regular attendants upon the ministrations of the
      Rev. James Trebeck in the picturesque old church at the end of Chiswick
      Mall, must often have witnessed the arrival of a well-known member of the
      congregation. Year after year had been wheeled, in a Bath chair, from a
      little villa under the wing of the Duke of Devonshire's mansion hard by, a
      stately old lady between seventy and eighty years of age, whose habitual
      costume was a silk sacque, a raised head-dress, and a black calash.
      Leaning heavily upon her crutched cane, and aided by the arm of a portly
      female relative in similar attire, she would make her way slowly and with
      much dignity up the nave, being generally preceded by a bent and
      white-haired man-servant, who, after carrying the prayer-books into the
      pew, and carefully closing the door upon his mistress and her companion,
      would himself retire to a remoter part of the building. From the
      frequenters of the place, the little procession attracted no more notice
      than any other recognized ceremonial, of which the intermission would
      alone have been remarkable; but it seldom failed to excite the curiosity
      of those wayfarers who, under the third George, already sought reverently,
      along the pleasant riverside, for that house in Mawson's Buildings where
      the great Mr. Pope wrote part of his 'Iliad,' or for the garden of
      Richard, Earl of Burlington, where idle John Gay gorged himself with
      apricots and peaches. They would be told that the elder lady was the widow
      of the famous painter, William Hogarth, who lay buried under the
      teacaddy-like tomb in the neighbouring churchyard; that her companion was
      her cousin, Mary Lewis, in whose arms he died; and that the old servant's
      name was Samuel. For five and twenty years Mrs. Hogarth survived her
      husband, during all of which time she faithfully cherished his memory.
      Those who visited her at her Chiswick home (for she had another in
      Leicester Fields) would recall with what tenacity she was wont to combat
      the view that he was a mere maker of caricatura, or, at best, 'a writer of
      comedy with the pencil,' as Mr. Horace Walpole (whose overcritical book
      she had not even condescended to acknowledge) had thought fit to designate
      him. It was as a painter pure and simple, as a rival of the Guidos and
      Correggios, that she mainly valued her William. 'They said he could not
      colour!' she would cry, pointing, it may be, as a protest against the
      words, to the brilliant sketch of the 'Shrimp Girl,' now in the National
      Gallery, but then upon her walls. Or, turning from his merits to his
      memory, she would throw a shawl about her handsome head and, stepping out
      under the over-hanging bay-window into the old three-cornered garden with
      its filbert avenue and its great mulberry tree, would exhibit the little
      mural tablet which Hogarth had himself scratched with a nail, in
      remembrance of a favourite bullfinch. 'Alass poor Dick,' ran the
      faint-lined inscription, not without characteristic revelation of the
      sculptor's faulty spelling. And if she happened to be in one of the more
      confidential moods of old age, she would perhaps take from a drawer that
      very No. 17 of the 'North Briton,' which she afterwards gave to Ireland,
      and which her husband, she would tell you, had carried about in his pocket
      for days to show to sympathetic friends. 'The <i>supposed</i> author of
      the <i>Analysis of beauty!</i>'&mdash;she would indignantly exclaim,
      quoting from the opening lines of Wilkes's nefarious print, headed with
      its rude woodcut parody of Hogarth's portrait in 'Calais Gate,' * and
      then, turning the blunt-lettered page, she would point silently to the
      passages relating to the much-abused 'Sigismunda,' concerning which, if
      her hearers were still judiciously inquisitive, they would, in all
      probability, receive a gracious invitation to test the truth of the libel
      by inspecting that masterpiece itself at its home in her London house.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The original No. 17 of the 'North Briton,' dated Saturday,
     September 25, 1762, had no portrait. The portrait was added
     to a reprint of Wilkes's article issued May 21, 1763, or
     immediately after the appearance of Hogarth's etching of
     Wilkes. Since the above paper was first published in
     America, this interesting relic of Hogarth has once more
     come to light. In April, 1845, it was sold with Mr. H. P.
     Standly's collection. At the sale, in February, 1892, of Dr.
     J. R. Joly's Hogarth prints and books, it passed (with some
     of the Standly correspondence) to Mr. James Tregaskis, the
     well-known bookseller at the 'Caxton Head' in Holborn, from
     whom it was acquired by the present writer. By November,
     1789, however, all this had become 'portion and parcel' of
     the irrevocable past.
</pre>
    <p>
      In that month Mrs. Hogarth had been laid beside her mother and her husband
      under the tomb in Chiswick churchyard; the little 'country box' had passed
      to Mary Lewis; and&mdash;by direction of the same lady&mdash;the contents
      of the 'Golden Head' in Leicester Fields were shortly afterwards (April,
      1790) announced for sale. In the Print Room at the British Museum (where
      is also the original manuscript of the famous 'Five Days' Tour' of 1732)
      is a copy of the auctioneer's catalogue, which once belonged to George
      Steevens. It is not a document of many pages. At Mrs. Hogarth's death, her
      income from the prints, exclusive property in which had been secured to
      her in 1767 by special Act of Parliament, had greatly fallen off; and
      though she had received the further aid of a small pension from the Royal
      Academy, it is to be presumed that her means were considerably straitened.
      It is known, too, that there had been lodgers at the 'Golden Head,' one
      being the engraver Richard Livesay, another the strange Ossianic
      enthusiast and friend of Fuseli, Alexander Runciman; and obviously nothing
      but 'strong necessity' could justify the reception of lodgers. These
      circumstances must explain the slender contents of Mr. Auctioneer
      Greenwood's little pamphlet. Many of the treasures of William Hogarth's
      household had already become the prey of the collector, or had passed to
      admiring friends; and what remained to be finally dispersed under the
      hammer practically consisted of family relics. There was Hogarth's own
      likeness of himself and his dog, soon to become the property of Mr.
      Angerstein, from whom it passed to the National Gallery; there was another
      whole-length of painting of him; there was Roubiliac's clever <i>terra
      cotta</i>; there was a cast of the faithful Trump, and one of Hogarth's
      hand; there were the portraits of his sisters Mary and Ann, which now
      belong to Mr. R. C. Nichols. Other items were a set of 'twelve Delft ware
      plates,' painted with the signs of the zodiac by Sir James Thornhill;
      portraits of Sir James and his wife; of Mrs. Hogarth herself; of Hogarth's
      six servants; and there were also numerous framed examples of his prints.
      * But the most important object in the sale was undoubtedly the famous
      'Sigismunda.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * By a piece of auction-room humour, 'The Bathos' appears as
     'The Bathers.'

    <p>
      'Sigismunda Mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo' is the full title of the
      picture in the National Gallery catalogue. As one looks at it now,
      asylumed safely, <i>post tot discrimina</i>, in Trafalgar Square, it is
      not so much its qualities as its story that it recalls. How much
      heartburning, how much bitterness, would have been saved to its sturdy
      little 'Author,' as he loved to style himself, if it had never been
      projected! He was an unparalleled pictorial satirist; he was, and still
      is, an unsurpassed story-teller upon canvas.

      Thus even his enemy and assailant, Charles Churchill. But Hogarth had the
      misfortune to live in an age when Art was given over to the bubblemongers
      and 'black masters;' when, to the suppression of native talent, sham <i>chefs
      d'ouvre</i> were praised extravagantly by sham connoisseurs; and the
      patriotic painter of 'Marriage À-la-Mode' justly resented the invasion of
      the country by the rubbish of the Roman art-factories. Had he confined
      himself to the forcible indignation of which, as an impenitent islander,
      he possessed unlimited command, it would have been better for his peace of
      mind. But, in an unpropitious hour, he undertook to prove his case by
      demonstration. Among the pictures from Sir Luke Schaub's collection,
      offered for sale in 1758, was a 'Sigismunda,' attributed to Correggio, but
      in reality from the brush of the far inferior artist, Furini. It was
      recklessly run up by the virtuosi, and was finally bought in for over
      £400. Hogarth, whose inimitable 'Marriage' had fetched only £126 (frames
      included), determined to paint the same subject. He had an open commission
      from Sir Richard Grosvenor, a wealthy art-collector, who had been one of
      the bidders for the Furini, and he set to work. He took unusual pains&mdash;a
      thing which, in his case, was of evil augury; and he modified the details
      of his design again and again, in obedience to the suggestions of friends.
      When at last the picture was completed, Sir Richard, who, perhaps not
      unreasonably, had looked for something more in the artist's individual
      manner, took advantage of Hogarth's conventional offer to release him from
      his bargain, and rather shabbily withdrew from it upon the specious ground
      'that the constantly having it [the picture] before one's eyes would be
      too often occasioning melancholy ideas'&mdash;a sentiment which the
      irritated painter, calling verse to his relief, afterwards neatly
      paraphrased. Admitting its power to touch the heart to be the 'truest
      test' of a masterpiece, he says of 'Sigismunda':
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Nay;'tis so moving that the Knight
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Can't even bear it in his sight;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then who would tears so dearly buy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As give four hundred pounds to cry?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I own, he chose the prudent part,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Rather to break his word than heart;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And yet, methinks,'tis ticklish dealing
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With one so delicate&mdash;in feeling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of Sir Richard Grosvenor's action, the picture remained on the
      artist's hands,&mdash;a source of continual mortification to himself, and
      a fruitful theme of discussion to both his friends and enemies. The
      political caricaturists got hold of it, and used it as a stick to beat the
      pensionary of Lord Bute; the critics employed it to continue their
      assaults on the precepts of the 'Analysis.' When Wilkes retorted to
      Hogarth's ill-advised print of the 'Times,' he openly described
      'Sigismunda' as a portrait of Mrs. Hogarth 'in an agony of passion;' and
      the fact that she had served as her husband's model was not neglected by
      his meaner assailants. Finally, after various attempts had been made to
      engrave it, the picture was left by the artist to his widow with
      injunctions not to sell it for less than £500. After her death it was
      bought at the 'Golden Head' sale for £56 by Alderman Boydell. As already
      stated, it is now in the National Gallery, to which it was bequeathed by
      the late Mr. Anderdon in 1879.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the couplets already quoted, Hogarth had ended by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Let the picture rust.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Perhaps Time's price-enhancing dust,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As statues moulder into earth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When I'm no more, may mark its worth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And future connoisseurs may rise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Honest as ours, and full as wise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To puff the piece and painter too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And make me then what Guido's now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent the reaction he hoped for has arrived. The latter-day
      student of 'Sigis-munda,' unblinded by political prejudice or private
      animosity, renders full justice to the soundness of its execution and the
      undoubted skill of its technique. Indeed, at the present moment, the
      tendency seems to be rather to overrate than to underrate its praiseworthy
      qualities. Yet, when all is said, the subject remains an unattractive and
      even a repulsive one. It must be admitted also that, in one respect,
      contemporary critics were right. They were wrong in their unreasoning
      preference for doubtful 'exotics,' but they were right in their contention
      that, upon this occasion, Hogarth had strayed perilously from his own
      peculiar walk, and that so-called 'history painting' was <i>not</i> his
      strongest point. Conscientious and painstaking, 'Sigismunda' is still a
      mistake, although it is the mistake of a great artist; and Hogarth's
      recorded partiality for it affords but one more example of that
      unaccountable blindness which led Addison to put his poems before the
      'Spectator,' Prior to rank his 'Solomon' above the 'loose and hasty
      scribble' of 'Alma,' and Liston, whose nose alone was provocative of
      laughter, to cherish the extraordinary delusion that his true vocation was
      that of a tragic actor.

    <h2>
      X. 'THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.'
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT was it that
      suggested to Goldsmith raphers and commentators have pointed to more than
      one plausible model,&mdash;the 'Lettres Persanes' of Montesquieu, the
      'Lettres d'une Péruvienne' of Madame de Graffigny, the 'Lettres Chinoises'
      of the Marquis d'Argens, the 'Asiatic' of Voltaire's 'Lettres
      Philosophiques.' But it is sometimes wise, especially in such
      hand-to-mouth work as journalism, which was all Goldsmith at first
      intended, to seek for origins in the immediate neighbourhood rather than
      in remoter places. In 1757 Horace Walpole published anonymously, in
      pamphlet form, a clever little squib upon Admiral Byng's 'The Citizen of
      the World'? Biogtrial in particular and English inconstancy in general,
      which he entitled 'A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher at London,
      to his friend Lien Chi, at Peking.' This was briefly noticed in the May
      issue of the 'Monthly Review,' where Goldsmith was then acting as
      scribbler-general to Griffiths, the proprietor of the magazine (his
      reviews of Home's 'Douglas' and of Burke's 'Sublime and Beautiful'
      appeared in the same number), and it was described as in Montesquieu's
      manner. A year later Goldsmith is writing mysteriously to his friend Bob
      Bryan-ton, of Ballymulvey, in Ireland, about a 'Chinese whom he shall soon
      make talk like an Englishman;' and when at last his 'Chinese Letters,' as
      they were called at first, begin to appear in Newbury's 'Public Ledger,'
      he takes for the name of his Oriental, Lien Chi Altangi, one of Walpole's
      imaginary correspondents having been Lien Chi. This chain of association,
      if slight, is strong enough to justify some connection. The fundamental
      idea, no doubt, was far older than either Walpole or Goldsmith; but it is
      not too much to suppose that Walpole's <i>jeu d'esprit</i> supplied just
      that opportune suggestion which produced the remarkable and now
      too-much-neglected series of letters afterwards reprinted under the
      general title of 'The Citizen of the World.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The metaphors and illusions,' says Goldsmith in one of those admirable
      prefaces of which he possessed the secret, 'are all drawn from the East;'
      and in another place he tells us that a certain apostrophe is wholly
      translated from Ambulaaohamed, a real (or fictitious) Arabian poet. To
      these ingenuities he no doubt attached the exaggerated importance
      habitually assigned to work which has cost its writer pains. But it is not
      the adroitness of his adaptations from Le Comte and Du Halde that most
      detains us now. The purely Oriental part of the work&mdash;although it
      includes the amusing story (an 'Ephesian Matron' <i>à la Chinoise</i>) of
      the widow who, in her haste to marry again, fans her late husband's grave
      to dry it quicker, and the apologue of Prince Bonbennin and the White
      Mouse&mdash;is practically dead wood. It is Goldsmith under the
      transparent disguise of Lien Chi&mdash;Goldsmith commenting, after the
      manner of Addison and Steele, upon Georgian England, that attracts and
      interests the modern reader. His Chinese Philosopher might well have
      wondered at the lazy puddle moving muddily along the ill-kept London
      streets, at the large feet and white teeth of the women, at the unwieldy
      signs with their nondescript devices, at the unaccountable fashion of
      lying-in-state; but it is Goldsmith, and Goldsmith only, who could have
      imagined the admirable humour of the dialogue on liberty between a
      prisoner (through his grating), a porter pausing from his burden to
      denounce slavery and the French, and a soldier who, with a tremendous
      oath, advocates, above all, the importance of religion. It is Goldsmith
      again&mdash;the Goldsmith of Green-Arbour-Court and Griffith's
      back-parlour&mdash;who draws, from a harder experience than could have
      been possible to Lien Chi, the satiric picture of the so-called republic
      of letters which forms his twentieth epistle. 'Each looks upon his fellow
      as a rival, not an assistant in the same pursuit. They calumniate, they
      injure, they despise, they ridicule each other: if one man writes a book
      that pleases, others shall write books to show that he might have given
      still greater pleasure, or should not have pleased. If one happens to hit
      on something new, there are numbers ready to assure the public that all
      this was no novelty to them or the learned; that Cardanus or Brunus, or
      some other author too dull to be generally read, had anticipated the
      discovery. Thus, instead of uniting like the members of a commonwealth,
      they are divided into almost as many factions as there are men; and their
      jarring constitution, instead of being styled a republic of letters,
      should be entitled an anarchy of literature.' One rubs one's eyes as one
      reads; one asks oneself under one's breath if it is of our day that the
      satirist is speaking. No; it is of the reign of the second of the Georges,
      before Grub Street was turned into Milton Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature, in its different aspects, plays not a small part in the
      lucubrations of Lien Chi. Two of the best letters are devoted to a
      whimsical description of the vagaries of some of its humbler professors,
      who hold a Saturday Club at the 'Broom' at Islington; others treat of the
      decay of poetry; of novels, and 'Tristram Shandy' in particular; of the
      necessity of intrigue or riches as a means to success. Nor are Art and the
      Drama neglected. The virtuoso, who afforded such a fund of amusement to
      Fielding and Smollett, receives his full share of attention; and in the
      papers upon acting and actors, Goldsmith once more displays that critical
      common-sense which he had shown so conspicuously in 'The Bee.' Travellers
      and their trivialities are freely ridiculed; there are papers on
      Newmarket, on the Marriage Act, on the coronation, on the courts of
      justice; on quacks, gaming, paint, mourning, and mad dogs. There is a
      letter on the irreverent behaviour of the congregation in St. Paul's;
      there is another on the iniquity of making shows of public monuments. Now
      and then a more serious note is touched, as when the author is stirred to
      unwonted gravity by the savage penal code of his day, which, 'cementing
      the laws with blood,' closed every avenue with a gibbet, and against which
      Johnson too lifted his sonorous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Scarce can our fields, such crowds at Tyburn die,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With hemp the gallows and the fleet supply,'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      he sang in 'London,' anticipating his later utterances in 'The Rambler.'
      Goldsmith, on the other hand, crystallized in his verse the raw material
      of which he made his Chinese philosopher the mouthpiece. Several of the
      best known passages of his two longest poems have their first form in the
      prose of Lien Chi. Indeed, one actual line of 'The Traveller,' 'A land of
      tyrants, and a den of slaves,' is simply a textual quotation from 'The
      Citizen of the World.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But what in the Chinese letters is even more remarkable than their clever
      raillery of social incongruities and abuses, is their occasional
      indication of the author's innate but hitherto undisclosed gift for the
      delineation of humorous character. Up to this time he had exhibited no
      particular tendency in this direction. The little sketches of Jack Spindle
      and 'my cousin Hannah,' in 'The Bee,' go no farther than the corresponding
      personifications of particular qualities in the 'Spectator' and 'Tatler;'
      and they are not of the kind which, to employ a French figure, 'enter the
      skin' of the personality presented. But in the case of the eccentric
      philanthropist of 'The Citizen of the World,' whom he christens the 'Man
      in Black,' he comes nearer to such a definite embodiment as Addison's
      'Will Wimble.' The 'Man in Black' is evidently a combination of some of
      those Goldsmith family traits which were afterwards so successfully
      recalled in Dr. Primrose, Mr. Hardcastle, and the clergyman of 'The
      Deserted Village.' The contrast between his credulous charity and his
      expressed distrust of human nature, between his simulated harshness and
      his real amiability, constitutes a type which has since been often used
      successfully in English literature; it is clear, too, that in the account
      of his life he borrows both from his author and his author's father. When
      he speaks of his unwillingness to take orders, of his dislike to wear a
      long wig when he preferred a short one, or a black coat when he dressed in
      brown, he is only giving expression to that incompatibility of temper
      which led to Goldsmith's rejection for ordination by the Bishop of Elphin;
      while in his picture of his father's house, with its simple, kindly
      prodigality, its little group of grateful parasites who laugh, like Mr.
      Hardcastle's servants, at the host's old jokes, and the careless paternal
      benevolence which makes the children 'mere machines of pity,' 'instructed
      in the art of giving away thousands before they were taught the more
      necessary qualifications of getting a farthing,' one recognizes the
      environment of that emphatically Irish household on the road from
      Ballymahon to Athlone, in which Goldsmith's own boyhood had been spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent as he is, however, the 'Man in Black,' with his grudging
      generosity and his 'reluctant goodness,' is surpassed in completeness of
      characterization by the more finished portrait of Beau Tibbs. The poor
      little pinched pretender to fashion, with his tarnished finery and his
      reed-voiced, simpering helpmate,&mdash;with his coffee-house cackle of my
      Lord Mudler and the Duchess of Piccadilly, and his magnificent promises of
      turbot and ortolan, which issue pitifully in postponed ox-cheek and bitter
      beer,&mdash;approaches the dimensions of a masterpiece. Charles Lamb, one
      would think, must have rejoiced over the reckless assurance which
      expatiates on the charming view of the Thames from the garret of a
      back-street in the suburbs, which glorifies the 'paltry, unframed
      pictures' on its walls into essays in the manner of the celebrated Grisoni
      and transforms a surly Scotch hag-of-all-work into an old and privileged
      family-servant,&mdash;the gift 'of a friend of mine, a Parliament man from
      the Highlands.' Nor are there many pages in Dickens more perennially
      humorous than the scene in which the 'Man in Black,' his <i>inamorata</i>
      the pawnbroker's widow, and Mr. and Mrs. Tibbs, all make a party to the
      picturesque old Vauxhall Gardens of Jonathan Tyers. The inimitable
      sparring which ensues between the second-hand gentility of the beau's lady
      and the moneyed vulgarity of the tradesman's relict, their different and
      wholly irreconcilable views of the entertainment, and the tragic
      termination of the whole, by which the widow is balked of 'the waterworks'
      because good manners constrain her to sit out the wiredrawn <i>roulades</i>
      and quavers of Mrs. Tibbs&mdash;these are things which age cannot wither
      nor custom stale. If Goldsmith had written nothing but this miniature
      trilogy of Beau Tibbs,&mdash;if Dr. Primrose were uninvented and Tony
      Lumpkin non-existent,&mdash;he would still have earned a perpetual place
      among English humourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this, undoubtedly, he owed to the fortunate instinct which
      dictated his choice of his material. The forerunner of Dickens,&mdash;the
      disciple, although he knew it not, of Fielding,&mdash;he makes his capital
      by his disregard of the reigning models of his time. Declining to select
      his characters from the fashionable abstractions of Sentimental Comedy and
      the mechanical puppets of conventional High Life, he turns aside to the
      moving, various, many-coloured middle-classes, from whose ranks
      originality has not yet been banished, or nature cast out. Of these he had
      knowledge and experience; of those he had seen but little. Upon the other
      walk, his labours might have been as forgotten as the 'Henry' of Richard
      Cumberland or the 'Henrietta' of Mrs. Charlotte Lenox. But he took his own
      line; and in consequence, Beau Tibbs and the pawnbroker's widow (with her
      rings and her green damask) are as much alive to-day as Partridge or Mrs.
      Nickleby.

      XI. AN OLD LONDON BOOKSELLER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EC. 22. Mr. John
      Newbery, of St. Paul's who knew him.' These words, copied from the
      'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1767, record the death of one who, in his way,
      was an eighteenth century notability. He belonged to the good old
      'Keep-your-Shop-and-your-Shop-will-keep-you' class of tradesmen, who lived
      without pretence near their places of business in the City, worked
      industriously during the week, marched off to St. Bride's or St. Dunstan's
      on Sunday morning with a crop-eared 'prentice in the rear to carry the
      great gilt Bible, and jogged away in crowded chaises of summer afternoons
      to eat tarts at Highgate or drink tea out of china in the Long churchyard,
      sincerely lamented by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time they made their 'plumbs;' sent their sons to St. Paul's or
      Merchant Taylors', sometimes even to Oxford or Cambridge; and finally left
      their portraits to posterity in the becoming and worshipful garb of
      Sheriffs or Common-councilmen. Unfortunately for this paper, there is no
      such limner's likeness of 'honest John Newbery.' Yet we are not wholly
      without details as to his character and personal appearance. That
      'glorious pillar of unshaken orthodoxy,' Dr. Primrose, formerly of
      Wakefield, for whom, as all the world knows, he had published a pamphlet'
      'against the Deuterogamists of the age,' describes him as a red-faced,
      good-natured little man, who was always in a hurry. 'He was no sooner
      alighted,' says the worthy Vicar, 'but he was in haste to be gone; for he
      was ever on business of the utmost importance.' 'Mr. Idler' confirms this
      indication. 'When he enters a house, his first declaration is, that he
      cannot sit down; and so short are his visits, that he seldom appears to
      have come for any other reason but to say, He must go.' It is not
      difficult to fill in the outline of Johnson and Goldsmith. 'The
      philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's church-yard' was plainly a
      bustling, multifarious, and not unkindly personage, essentially
      commercial, essentially enterprising, rigorously exacting his money's
      worth of work, keeping prudent record of all casual cash advances, but, on
      the whole, not unbeneficent in his business fashion to the needy brethren
      of the pen by whom he was surrounded. Many of John Newbery's guineas
      passed to Johnson, to Goldsmith, to poor mad Christopher Smart, who
      married his step-daughter. As Johnson implies, it is not impossible that
      he finally fell a victim to that unreasoning mental activity which left
      him always struggling hopelessly with more schemes and proposals than one
      man could possibly manage. His wig must often have been awry, and his
      spectacles mislaid, in that perpetual journey from pillar to post which
      ultimately landed him, at the comparatively early age of fifty-four, in
      his grave at Waltham St. Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Waltham St. Lawrence, a quiet little Berkshire village, whose
      churchyard is dotted with the tombs of earlier Newberys, that he had been
      born. His father, a small farmer, destined him for his own calling. But,
      like Gay, it was not John Newbery's fate 'to brighten ploughshares in
      paternal land.' He passed early into the service of a 'merchant,'
      otherwise a printer and newspaper proprietor, at Reading, managing so well
      that, when his employer died, he was left a co-legatee in the business.
      Thereupon, being a resolute man, he did better still, and married his
      master's widow, who had three children. Even this succeeded; upon which,
      progressing always in prosperity, he began to think of starting in London.
      Before doing so, he made a tour in the provinces. Of this expedition there
      exists a curious record in the shape of an unprinted journal, throwing
      much light upon modes of travelling in those early coaching days, when the
      unfortunate outside passenger (like Pastor Moritz in a later paper *) had
      to choose between being jolted to death in the basket, or clinging like a
      fly to the slippery top of the vehicle.

      The majority of the entries are merely matter of business,&mdash;titles
      for new books, recipes for diet-drinks, shrewd trade maxims, and the like.
      But here and there the writer intersperses notes of general interest,&mdash;on
      Dick Turpin the highwayman, on Lady Godiva and peeping Tom, and (more than
      once) upon that 'curious and very useful machine,' the Ducking-Stool for
      scolds, a 'plan of which instrument (he says) he shall procure and
      transplant to Berkshire for the good of his native county.' His business
      at Reading was as miscellaneous as his memorandum book, and he seems to
      have dealt in all kinds of goods. About 1744 he removed to London, opening
      a shop at the sign of the 'Bible and Crown,' near Devereux Court, without
      Temple Bar, together with a branch establishment at the Royal Exchange. To
      this Johnson probably refers when he says: 'He has one habitation near Bow
      Church, and another about a mile distant. By this ingenious distribution
      of himself between two houses, he has contrived to be found at neither.'
      From the 'Bible and Crown,' which had been his old Reading sign, he moved
      a year later to the 'Bible and Sun' in St. Paul's Churchyard. This
      continued to be his headquarters until his death. Gradually his
      indiscriminate activities narrowed themselves to two distinct branches of
      business, in these days incongruous enough,&mdash;the sale of books and
      the sale of patent medicines. While at Reading, he had become part owner,
      among other things, of Dr. Hooper's Female Pills; and soon after his
      settlement in London, he acquired the sole management of a more famous
      panacea, Dr. James's Fever Powders, which had in their time an
      extraordinary vogue. According to Mrs. Delany, the King dosed the Princess
      Elizabeth with them; Gray and Cowper both believed in their efficacy; and
      Horace Walpole, declared he should take them if the house were on fire.
      Fielding specially praises them in 'Amelia,' affirming that in almost any
      country but England they would have brought 'public Honours and Rewards'
      to his 'worthy and ingenious Friend Dr. James;' while Goldsmith may be
      said to have laid down his life for them. With the sale of these and
      kindred specifics, John Newbery alternated his unwearied speculations as a
      bookseller. He was at the back of Smollett's venture of the 'British
      Magazine;' it was for his 'Universal Chronicle' that Johnson wrote his
      'Idler' and quizzed his proprietor as 'Jack Whirler;' he was the publisher
      of Goldsmith's 'Traveller' and 'Citizen of the World;' and lie probably
      found part of the historical sixty guineas which somebody paid for the
      'Vicar of Wakefield.' He died at Canbury or Canonbury House, Islington, in
      the still-existent Tower of which he was an occasional resident. Indeed,
      it is more than probable that he was at one time the responsible landlord
      of that favourite retiring place for literary men,&mdash;a retiring place
      not without its exceptional advantages, if we* are to believe last-century
      advertisements, which, in addition to a natural cold bath, speak of 'a
      superlative Room, furnish'd for a single Person, or two Gentlemen, having
      a Prospect into five Counties ['<i>longos prospicit agros!</i>'], and the
      use of a good Garden and Summer-House.' Besides this there were traditions
      of Prior Bolton and Anne of Cleves, of Bacon and Elizabeth, of Sir John
      Spencer and William Fielding, Earl of Denbigh (the novelist's
      grand-uncle), which certainly have figured in any schedule of attractions,
      and must naturally have been interesting to the Smarts and Hills and
      Woodfalls and Goldsmiths who afterwards inhabited the old ivy-clad Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newbery's epitaph in the churchyard of his native village lays its main
      stress upon his connection with Dr. James's nostrum; and it was doubtless
      to this and the other patent medicines with which he was connected that he
      owed the material part of his prosperity. Yet it is not now upon the
      celebrated 'Arquebusade Water' (dear to Lady Mary Coke), or the far-famed
      'Cephalic Snuff,' or the incomparable 'Beaume de Vie,' once so familiar in
      eighteenth-century advertisements, that he bases his individual claim to
      the gratitude of posterity. It is, to quote his biographer, Mr. Welsh, as
      'the first bookseller who made the issue of books, specially intended for
      children, a business of any importance;' as the publisher of 'The Renowned
      History of Giles Gingerbread: a little Boy who lived upon Learning,' of
      'Mrs. Margery Two-Shoes' (afterward Lady Jones), of the redoubtable 'Tommy
      Trip and his dog Jouler,' of the 'Lilliputian Magazine,' and of numbers of
      other tiny masterpieces in that flowered and gilt Dutch paper of which the
      art has been lost, that he is best remembered. Concerning these
      commendable little treatises, with their matter-of-fact title-pages and
      their artless appeal to all little Masters and Misses 'who are good, or
      intend to be good,' there are varying opinions. Dr. Johnson, according to
      Mrs. Thrale, thought them too childish for their purpose. He preferred the
      'Seven Champions,' or 'Parisenus and Parismenus.' 'Babies,' he said in his
      legislative way, 'do not want to hear about babies. They like to be told
      of giants and castles, and of somewhat which can stretch and stimulate
      their little minds.' 'Remember always,' he added, 'that the parents buy
      the books, and that the children never read them.' Yet it is claimed for
      Robert Southey that in Newbery's 'delectable histories' he found just that
      very stimulus which made him a life-long book-lover; and it is
      characteristic of Charles Lamb (a better judge of children's literature
      than Johnson) that he puts forward these particular publications against
      the Bar-baulds and Trimmers ('those blights and blasts of all that is
      human in man and child'), as presenting the very quality which Johnson
      desired, the 'beautiful interest in wild tales, which made the child a
      man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a
      child.' 'Think what you would have been now,' he writes to Coleridge of
      'Goody Two-Shoes,' 'if instead of being fed with tales and old wives'
      fables in childhood, you had been crammed with geography and natural
      history!' The authorship of these 'classics of the nursery' is an old
      battle ground. Newbery, it is alleged, wrote some of them himself. He was
      (says Dr. Primrose when he met him) 'at that time actually compiling
      materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip,' and if this can hardly
      be accepted as proof positive, it may be safely asserted that to Newbery's
      business instincts are due those ingenious references to his different
      wares and publications which crop up so unexpectedly in the course of the
      narrative. For example, in 'Goody Two-Shoes' we are told that the
      heroine's father 'died miserably' because he was 'seized with a violent
      Fever in a place where Dr. James's Powder was not to be had!' But who were
      Newbery's assistant authors? Giles and Griffith Jones, say some; Oliver
      Goldsmith, say others. With respect to the last-named no particular
      testimony seems to be forthcoming beyond his known relations to the
      publisher, and the so-called 'evidence of style.' In the absence of
      confirmatory details the former is worthless; and the latter is often
      entirely misleading. Without going back to the time-honoured case of
      Erasmus and Scaliger's oration, two modern instances of this may be cited.
      Mr. Thackeray, says Mr. Forster, claimed the 'Pleasant and Delightful
      History of Thomas Hickathrift' for Henry Fielding. But both Mr. Forster
      and Mr. Thackeray should have remembered that their common acquaintance,
      Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff, of the 'Tatler,' had written of Hickathrift as a
      chap-book when Fielding was a baby. In the same way 'Tommy Trip' has, by
      no mean judges, been attributed to Goldsmith upon the strength of the
      following quatrain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Three children sliding on the ice
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Upon a summer's day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As it fell out they all fell in,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      The rest they ran away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! and alas! for the 'evidence of style.' Not only had these identical
      lines been turned into Latin in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for July, 1754,
      when Goldsmith was still studying medicine at Leyden; but they are quoted
      at p. 30 of 'The Character of Richard St[ee]le,
    </p>
    <p>
      Esq;' by 'Toby, Abel's Kinsman,' which was issued by 'J. Morphew, near
      Stationer's Hall,' as far back as the month of November, 1713. As a matter
      of fact, they are much older still, being affirmed by Chambers in his
      excellent 'Book of Days' to be, in their first form, part of a long and
      rambling story in doggerel rhyme dating from the early part of the Civil
      Wars, which is to be found at the end of a little old book entitled 'The
      Loves of Hero and Leander,' 12mo, London, 1653, and 1677.

    <h2>
      XII. GRAY'S LIBRARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>MONG Gray's papers
      was one inscribed 'Dialogue of Books.' The handwriting was that of his
      biographer Mason, but it was believed to be either by Gray or by West.
      There is a strong presumption that the author was Gray; and it is
      accordingly attributed to him in the Rev. D. C. Tovey's 'Gray and his
      Friends,' where for the first time it was printed. It shows us the little
      great man (if it is accurately dated 1742, it must have been in the year
      of his fullest poetical activity) sitting tranquilly in his study chair,
      when he is 'suddenly alarmd with a great hubbub of Tongues.' He listens;
      and finds that his books are talking to one another. Madame de Sévigné is
      being what Mrs. Gamp would call 'scroudged' by Aristotle, who replies to
      her compressed expostulations with all the brutality of a philosopher and
      a realist. Thereupon she appeals to her relative, the author of the
      'Histoire amoureuse des Gaules.' But the gallant M. Bussy-Rabutin, himself
      pining for an interchange of compliments with a neighbouring Catullus, is
      hopelessly penned in by a hulking edition of Strabo, and cannot possibly
      arrive to the assistance of his <i>belle Cousine</i>. Elsewhere La Bruyère
      comments upon the strange companions with whom Fate has acquainted him;
      and Locke observes, with a touch of temper, that <i>he</i> is associated
      with Ovid,&mdash;and Ray the Naturalist! * Virgil placidly quotes a line
      of his own poems; More, the Platonist, delivers himself of a neat little
      copybook sentiment in praise of theological speculation; and great fat Dr.
      Cheyne huskily mutters his own adage, 'Every man after forty is either a
      fool or a Physician.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ray's 'Select Remains' with life by Derham, 1740, and many
     marginal notes by Gray, was recently in a London
     bookseller's catalogue.
</pre>
    <p>
      In another corner an ill-judged and irrelevant remark by Euclid, touching
      the dimensions of a point, brings down upon him the scorn both of Swift
      and Boileau, who clamour for the unconditional suppression of mathematics.
      (If there be nothing else, this in itself is almost sufficient to fix the
      authorship of the paper with Gray, whose hatred of mathematics was only
      equalled by that of Goldsmith.) Then a pert exclamation from a
      self-sufficient <i>Vade Mecum</i> provokes the owner of the library to so
      hearty an outburst of merriment that the startled tones at once shrink
      back into 'uncommunicating muteness.' Laughter, it would seem, is as fatal
      to books as it was of old to the Coquecigrues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Gray's library ever again broke silence, his biographers have not
      related. But if his books were pressed for space while in his possession,
      they have since enjoyed ample opportunities for change of air and scene.
      When he died he left them, with his manuscripts, to Mason, who in turn
      bequeathed them to the poet's friend Stonehewer, from whom they passed, in
      part, to a relative, Mr. Bright of Skeffington Hall. At Mr. Bright's
      death, being family property, they were sold by auction. In August, 1851,
      they were again offered for sale; and three years later a number of them,
      which had apparently been reserved or bought in, once more came under the
      hammer at Sotheby and Wilkinson's. We have before us the catalogue of the
      second sale, which is naturally much fuller than that of 1854. What
      strikes one first is the care with which the majority of the volumes had
      been preserved by their later possessors. Many of the Note-Books were
      cushioned on velvet in special cases, while the more precious manuscripts
      had been skilfully inlaid, and bound in olive morocco with leather joints
      and linings of crimson silk. Like Prior, Gray must have preserved almost
      everything, 'e'en from his boyish days.' Among the books is 'Plutarch's
      Lives,' with Dacier's notes, and the inscription, 'E libris Thomæ Gray,
      Scholæ Eton: Alumn. Januar. 22, 1733'&mdash;a year before he left for
      Cambridge; there is also his copy of Pope's 'Iliad,' with autograph date a
      year earlier; there is a still more youthful (though perhaps more
      suspicious) possession&mdash;namely, three volumes of Dryden's 'Virgil,'
      which were said to have actually belonged to Pope. 'Ex libris A. Pope,
      1710,' was written at the back of the portrait, and the same inscription
      recurred in each volume, though in the others some Vandal, probably a
      classmate, by adding a tail to the 'P' and an 'r' at the end, had turned
      the 'Pope' into 'Roper.' Another of Gray's Eton books was a Waller,
      acquired in 1729, in which favourite poems and passages were underlined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the classics he must have been a most unwearied and sedulous student.
      Euripides he read in the great folio of Joshua Barnes (Cantab. 1694),
      which is marked throughout by a special system of stars, inverted commas,
      and lines in red crayon; and his note-books bristle with extracts, neatly
      'arranged and digested,' from all the best Greek authors&mdash;Sophocles,
      Thucydides, Xenophon, and even that Isocrates whom Goldsmith, from the
      critical altitudes of the 'Monthly Review,' recommended him to study. At
      other 'classics' he worked with equal diligence. His 'Decameron'&mdash;the
      London <i>quarto</i> of 1725&mdash;was filled with <i>marginalia</i>
      identifying Boccaccio's sources of inspiration and principal imitators,
      while his Milton&mdash;the two-volume <i>duodecimo</i> of 1730-8&mdash;was
      interleaved,and annotated profusely with parallel passages drawn from the
      Bible, Dante, Shakespeare, and 'the ancients.'' He had crowded Dugdale's
      'Baronage' with corrections and additions; he had largely 'commented' the
      four folio volumes of Clarendon's 'Rebellion;' and he had followed
      everywhere, with remorseless rectifications, the vagrant utterances of
      gossiping Gilbert Burnet. His patience, accuracy, research, were not less
      extraordinary than his odd, out-of-the-way knowledge. In the 'Voyages de
      Bergeron' (quarto) that author says: 'Mango Cham fut noie.' No, comments
      Gray, decisively, 'Muncacâ or Mangu-Khanw was not drowned, but in reality
      slain in China at the siege of Hochew in 1258.' Which of us could oblige
      an inquisitive examiner with the biography of this Eastern potentate!
      Which of us would not be reduced to 'combining our information' (like the
      ingenious writer on Chinese Metaphysics) as to 'mangoes' and 'great
      Chams'!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the two most interesting items of the Catalogue are yet unmentioned.
      One is the laborious collection of Manuscript Music that Gray compiled in
      Italy while frivolous Horace Walpole was eating iced fruits in a domino to
      the sound of a guitar. Zamperelli, Pergolesi, Arrigoni, Galuppi&mdash;he
      has ransacked them all, noting the school of the composer and the source
      of the piece selected&mdash;copying out religiously even the 'Regole per
      l'Accompagnamento.' The other, which we who write have seen, is the famous
      Linnaeus exhibited at Cambridge in 1885 by Mr. Ruskin. It is an
      interleaved copy of the 'Systema Naturae,' two volumes in three, covered
      as to their margins and added pages with wonderful minute notes in Latin,
      and illustrated by Gray himself with delicately finished pen-and-ink
      drawings of birds and insects. During the later part of his life these
      volumes, we are told, were continually on his table, and his absorbing
      love for natural history is everywhere manifested in his journals and
      pocket-books. When he is in the country, he classes the plants; when in
      town, he notes the skins of birds in shops; and when he eats whitebait at
      Greenwich, he straightway describes that dainty in the language of
      Tacitus. <i>Nullus odor nisi Piscis; farina respersus, frixusque editur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the manuscripts proper of this collection, the place of honour
      belongs to one which Mason had labelled 'Original Copy of the Elegy in a
      Country Church Yard.' In addition to other variations from the printed
      text, erased words in this MS. showed that Cato stood originally for
      Hampden, and Tully and Cæsar for Milton and Cromwell:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      'Some mute inglorious Tully here may rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Some Cæsar guiltless of his country's blood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, too, were found those well-known but rejected 'additional' stanzas:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'The thoughtless World to Majesty may bow,

      Another group of autographs in this volume had a special interest. The
      first was the notelet, or 'spell,' which Lady Schaub and Miss Speed left
      for Gray upon that first call when the nervous poet was 'not at home' to
      his unexpected visitors. Next to this came the poem which the note
      elicited&mdash;that charming 'Long Story,' with its echo of Matthew Prior,
      which has set their tune to so many later verse-spinners:
    </p>
    <p>
      Does not one seem to catch in this the coming cadences of another haunter
      of the 'Poets' Walk' at Eton&mdash;of Winthrop Mackworth Praed; nay, an it
      be not <i>lèse majesté</i>, even of the lighter strains of Lord Tennyson
      himself! To the 'Long Story' followed Miss Speed's polite little
      acknowledgment with its invitation to dinner, and a few pages further on
      the verses beginning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      * Midst Beauty and Pleasure's gay Triumphs to languish,'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      which Gray probably wrote for her&mdash;verses in which there is more of
      poetic ardour than genuine passion. Gray was not a marrying man. Yet one
      feels half sorry that he was never united to 'Your oblig'd &amp; obedient
      Henrietta Jane Speed,' with her £30,000, her house in town, and her 'china
      and old japan infinite.' Still more to be resented is the freak of Fate
      which transformed the delightful Melissa of the 'Long Story' into the
      berouged French Baronne who, sixteen years later, in company with her
      lap-dogs, piping bullfinch, and cockatoo, arrived from the Hague as Madame
      de la Perrière, and 'Ministress at London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The large <i>quarto</i> volume containing the above poems also included
      the first sketch in red crayon of Gray's unfinished Latin Poem, 'De
      Principiis Cogitandi,' and a copy of the translation of the Ugolino
      episode from the 'Inferno,' first printed by Mr. Gosse in 1884. Of the
      volumes of miscellaneous MSS. (where was found the 'Dialogue of Books') it
      is impossible to speak here. But among the rest comes a copy of the
      'Strawberry Hill' edition of the 'Odes by Mr. Gray'&mdash;those Odes which
      at first he had so obstinately refused to annotate. 'If a thing cannot be
      understood without notes,' he told Walpole, 'it had better not be
      understood at all.' He must, however, have subsequently recanted, since
      this copy is filled with carefully written explanations of the allusions,
      and with indications of the sources of information. This book and the
      Note-books of Travel and Reading, with their methodical arrangement, their
      scrupulous accuracy, their unwearied pains, all help us to understand that
      leisurely fastidiousness, that hesitating dilettanteism, that endless
      preluding to unachieved performance, which make of the most literary,
      exact, and polished of poets, at the same time the least copious of
      writers. In his bust in the Pembroke College, Mr. Hamo Thorny-croft has
      happily succeeded in accentuating these qualities of refinement and
      intellectual precision. For the rest, is not Gray wholly contained in the
      vignette of Rogers to Mitford?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gray, he says, saw little society in London. He had 'a nice dinner from
      the Tavern brought to his lodgings, a glass or two of sweet wine, and
      [here is a delightful touch!] as he sippd it talked about great People.'
      It needs but to fill the room with those scarlet martagon-lilies and
      double stocks for which he trudged daily to Covent Garden, to spread a
      meteorological register upon the writing-table, to open Gavin Douglas his
      'Palice of Honour' in the window-seat&mdash;and the picture is finished.

      XIII. THE NEW CHESTERFIELD.

      detested proverbs. For him they were not so much the wit of one man and
      the wisdom of many, as the cheap rhetoric of the vulgar, to which no
      person of condition could possibly condescend. Yet it is his Lordship's
      misfortune to suggest one of the homeliest. Nothing so well describes the
      state of his modern reputation as the familiar adage, 'Give a dog a bad
      name, and hang him.' Dr. Johnson, who had more or less valid reasons for
      antagonism, characterized the famous letters in one of those vigorous
      verdicts, the compactness of which has sometimes been allowed to condone
      injustice. They taught, he declared, 'the morals of a courtesan, * and the
      manners of a dancing-master.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Modern usage here requires the alteration of a word.

    <p>
      Cowper followed suit. Addressing the author in the 'Progress of Error' as
      Petronius, he informed him that the tears of the Muses would 'scald his
      memory;' and after apostrophizing him as a 'graybeard corrupter of our
      listening youth,' and a 'polish'd and high-finish'd foe to Truth,' adjured
      him finally (and rather fatuously) to send from the shades some message of
      recantation,&mdash;in all of which there is more of poetic phraseology
      than energy of reproach. With the novelists Lord Chesterfield has hardly
      fared better. Dickens, who drew upon him for Sir John Chester in 'Barnaby
      Rudge,' makes that personage declare enthusiastically that 'in every page
      of this enlightened writer, he finds some captivating hypocrisy which had
      never occurred to him before, or some superlative piece of selfishness to
      which he was utterly a stranger.' The picture in Thackeray's 'Virginians'
      is quieter and more lifelike. We are shown Lord Chesterfield at Tunbridge,
      when Harry Warrington makes his <i>debut</i> there&mdash;'a little
      beetle-browed, hook-nosed, high-shouldered gentleman,' much like his
      portrait by Gainsborough, sitting over his wine at the White Horse with M.
      de Pollnitz, rallying and ironically complimenting that ambiguous
      adventurer, making magnificent apology to Mr. Warrington when he has
      unwittingly insulted him, and, at a later period, with his customary
      composure, losing six hundred pounds to him at cards. As to this last
      detail there may be doubts. Thackeray probably counted upon human frailty
      and the inveteracy of an ancient habit, but Lord Carnarvon says that Lord
      Chesterfield gave up play when he accepted office, and he had been
      Ambassador at the Hague and Viceroy in Ireland years before he met Colonel
      Esmond's grandson at M. Barbeau's much-frequented ordinary in the Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the two quarto volumes which, in March, 1774, were sent forth
      from Golden Square by that not entirely discreet and certainly rapacious
      representative, his Lordship's daughter-in-law, one's first impression is
      that they have been more talked about in the light of Johnson's epigram
      than read by that of their own merits. No one, of course, would affirm,
      even allowing for the corrupt state of the society in which they were
      written, that their moral tone, in one respect especially, is defensible;
      nor can it be denied, even supposing them to emanate from a friend rather
      than a parent, that they contain passages which, to our modern taste, are
      more than unpleasant. But without in the least attempting to extenuate
      these objectionable features of the correspondence, it is but just to its
      author to remember that it was never intended either for the public
      instruction or for the public eye. When Mrs. Eugenia Stanhope trusted the
      letters would be of use 'to the Youth of these Kingdoms,' she was palpably
      overlooking this obvious fact. If Lord Chesterfield had published them
      himself, he would no doubt have considerably edited them; but it is
      extremely unlikely that he would ever have published them at all. The
      principles which he desired to instil into Philip Stanhope were the
      principles of the society in which Philip Stanhope was moving&mdash;they
      were those of his patron, Lord Albemarle, and his preceptress, Lady
      Hervey. They were intended not for the world at large, but for the
      narrower world of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The systematic dissimulation which they appear to inculcate has also been
      urged against them. But here again it seems to have been forgotten that
      young Stanhope was intended for a politician and statesman,&mdash;that
      what his father most desired for him was the successes of a court and the
      rewards of diplomacy. After all, the <i>volto sciolto</i> and <i>pensieri
      stretti</i>, the 'looks loose' and 'thoughts close,' * which he so
      persistently enjoins, are no more than the unimpeachable Sir Henry Wotton
      impressed upon the equally unimpeachable John Milton.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A more popular rendering of this useful maxim is the
     'heyes hopen and mouth shut' of Thomas the footman in 'The
     Newcomes,' eh. xlvii.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lord Chesterfield puts his points coldly and cynically; but by his
      excellent sermon on the <i>suaviter in modo</i> and the <i>fortiter in re</i>,
      he preaches in reality little beyond that necessary conciliation of the
      feelings of others which is inculcated by almost every manual of ethics.
      Again, if he harps somewhat wearisomely upon '<i>les manières, les
      bienséances, les agrémens</i>, it is precisely because these were the weak
      points of his pupil, who, master at twenty of Latin, Greek, and political
      history, speaking readily German, French, and Italian, having a remarkable
      memory and a laudable curiosity, still retained an awkwardness of address
      which neither Marcel nor Desnoyers could wholly overcome, * and a
      defective enunciation which would have resisted all the pebbles of
      Demosthenes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Desnoyers was the fashionable English dancing-master;
     Marcel, the French one.
</pre>
    <p>
      For the rest, Lord Chesterfield's teaching is, in great measure,
      unexceptionable. Its worst fault, in addition to those already mentioned,
      is that it too frequently confuses being with seeming, and the assumption
      of a virtue with the actual possession of it. But many of its injunctions
      are most praiseworthy, and even admirable as aphorisms; and those to whom
      their note of worldly wisdom is distasteful must blame not so much the
      writer, as Horace and Cicero, Bolingbroke and La Bruyère, De Retz and La
      Rochefoucault, from whom he had compiled his rules for conduct, and shaped
      his scheme of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philip Stanhope died at six-and-thirty, neither '<i>paitri [sic] de
      graces</i>' as Lord Chesterfield hoped, nor particularly distinguished in
      statecraft (he was simply Envoy at Dresden), it was discovered that he had
      so far adopted the policy of '<i>pensieri stretti</i> as to have been
      married privately for some years. Probably the shock of this discovery was
      softened to his father (who nevertheless behaved liberally to the widow)
      by the fact that, in the failure of his plans for his son, he had already
      begun to interest himself in the training of another member of his family,
      a little boy who was destined to be his successor in the earldom. Seven
      years before Philip Stanhope's death he had opened a new series of letters
      with a godchild, also Philip Stanhope, and the son of Mr. Arthur Stanhope,
      of Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire. Beginning when the boy was five and a
      half, the correspondence was continued for nine years, following him from
      'Mr. Robert's boarding School at Marybone by London' to the house in
      Southampton Row of his tutor, the notorious Dr. Dodd. When the first
      letter was written, Lord Chesterfield was sixty-seven, and the last was
      penned only three years before his death. This is the collection which,
      after being mislaid for a long period, was published in 1889 by the late
      Lord Carnarvon, to whom it had been presented by his father-in-law, the
      sixth Earl of Chesterfield. It contributes not a little to the revision of
      the popular idea formed of the writer,&mdash;an idea, it may be added,
      which, upon re-examination of the earlier correspondence, had already been
      considerably modified by such critics as Mr. Abraham Hayward and M.
      Sainte-Beuve. Superficially, the letters resemble their predecessors, and
      the outline of education is much the same. Little Philip was to be
      'perfectly master' of that French which his godfather loved so dearly, and
      in which he wrote so often and so well; he was to be thoroughly grounded
      in History, Geography, Dancing, Italian, German; he was to be proficient
      in Greek and Latin, and he was to complete his studies in the
      'well-regulated republic' of Geneva, the salutary austerity of which was
      then usefully tempered by the presence of Voltaire and the French
      refugees. Many of the new letters reproduce the old precepts; there are
      even similarities of thought and phraseology; and though the <i>volto
      sciolto</i> is not obtruded, the <i>suaviter in modo</i> is still
      persistently advocated. But age has brought its softening influences&mdash;the
      moral tone is ostensibly higher, and the old worldly <i>savoir-faire</i>
      has lost much of its ancient cynicism. Some of the axioms which Lord
      Carnarvon quotes are remarkable for their accent of earnestness; others,
      as he observes, are 'almost theological' in tone. Saint Augustine, for
      example, could hardly say more than this: 'Si je pouvois empêcher qu'il
      n'y eut un seul malheureux sur la Terre, j'y sacrifierois avec plaisir mon
      bien, mes soins, et même ma santé. C'est le grand devoir de l'homme,
      surtout de l'homme chrétien.' The next is nearer to the elder manner:
      'Ayez une grande Charité pour l'amour de Dieu et une extrême politesse
      pour l'amour de vous même.' And here is a graver utterance than either:
      'God has been so good as to write in all our hearts the duty that He
      expects from us, which is adoration and thanksgiving and doing all the
      good we can to our fellow creatures.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is extraordingry to note what an infinity of trouble Lord Chesterfield
      took to arouse and amuse his little pupil. Sometimes the letter is an
      anecdote, biographical or historical; sometimes a cunningly contrived
      French vocabulary, one of which, <i>inter alia</i>, comprehensively
      defines 'Les Graces' as 'Something gracefull, genteel, and engaging in the
      air and figure.' Others (like the admirable papers in 'The World')
      denounce the prevailing vice of drunkenness. 'Fuyez le vin, car c'est un
      poison lent, mais sur.' Occasionally a little diagram aids the exposition,
      as when a rude circle, with a tiny figure at top, stands for 'le petit
      Stanhope' and 'ses antipodes;' in other cases, the course of instruction
      in politeness and public speaking is diversified by definitions of similes
      and metaphors, epigrams, anagrams, and <i>logogriphes</i>. Finally, there
      is a complete treatise, in fourteen epistles, on the 'Art of Pleasing,'
      from which we extract the following on wit and satire:
    </p>
    <p>
      'When wit exerts itself in satyr it is a most malignant distemper; wit it
      is true may be shown in satyr, but satyr does not constitute wit, as most
      fools imagine it does. A man of real wit will find a thousand better
      occasions of showing it. Abstain therefore most carefully from satyr,
      which though it fall upon no particular person in company, and momentarily
      from the malignity of the human heart, pleases all; upon reflexion it
      frightens all too, they think it may be their turn next, and will hate you
      for what they find you could say of them more, than be obliged to you for
      what you do not say. Fear and hatred are next door neighbours. The more
      wit you have the more good nature and politeness you must show, to induce
      people to pardon your superiority, for that is no easy matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! and alas! that so much labour and patience should have been lost.
      For Philip the Second, though he made no secret marriage, was not a much
      greater success than Philip the First. He turned out a commonplace country
      gentleman, amiable, methodical, agricultural, but wholly overshadowed and
      obliterated by the fame of the accomplished statesman and orator who had
      directed his studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The bows of eloquence are buried with the Archers.' It is impossible,
      even with the aid of the phonograph, to recapture the magnetic
      personality, the fervour of gesture that winged the words and carried
      conviction to the hearer. Equally impossible is it, in this age of
      egotisms and eccentricities that pass for character, to realize the
      fascination of those splendid manners for which Lord Chesterfield was
      celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finished elegance, the watchful urbanity, the perfect ease and
      self-possession, which Fielding commended, and Johnson could not contest,
      are things too foreign to our restless overconsciousness to be easily
      intelligible. But we can at least call up&mdash;not without compassionate
      admiration&mdash;the pathetic picture of the deaf old gentleman who had
      been the rival of 'silver-tongued Murray' and the correspondent of
      Montesquieu, sitting down at seventy in his solitary study at Babiole * to
      write, in that wonderful hand of which Lord Carnarvon gives a facsimile,
      his periodical letter of advice to a <i>petit bout d'homme</i> at Parson
      Dodd's in Southampton Row, concerning whose career in life he had formed
      the fondest&mdash;and the vainest&mdash;expectations.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Babiole was His Lordship's country-house at Blackheath, so
     entitled in imitation of Bagatelle, the seat near Paris of
     his friend Madame la Marquise de Monconseil. It was also the
     name of a house of Madame de Pompadour.

    <h2>
      XIV. A DAY AT STRAWBERRY HILL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O the rigorous
      exactitudes of modern realism it may seem an almost hopeless task to
      revive the details of a day in a Twickenham Villa when George the Third
      was King. And yet, with the aid of Horace Walpole's letters, of the
      'Walpoliana' of Pinkerton, and, above all, of the catalogue of Strawberry
      Hill printed by its owner in 1774, there is no insurmountable difficulty
      in deciding what must probably have been the customary course of events.
      Nothing is needed at the outset but to assume that you had arrived, late
      on the previous night, at the embattled Gothic building on the Teddington
      Road, and that the fatigues of your journey had left you little more than
      a vague notion of your host, and a fixed idea that the breakfast hour was
      nine. Then, after carrying with you into the chintz curtains of the Red
      Bedchamber an indistinct recollection of Richardson's drawings of Pope and
      his mother, and of Bermingham's 'owl cut in paper,' which you dimly make
      out with your candle on the walls, you would be waked at eight next
      morning by Colomb, the Swiss valet (as great a tyrant over his master as
      his compatriot Canton in the 'Clandestine Marriage'), and in due time
      would repair to the blue-papered and blue-furnished Breakfast Room,
      looking pleasantly on the Thames. Here, coasting leisurely round the
      apartment, you would probably pause before M. de Carmontel's double
      picture of your host's dead friend, Madame du Deffand, and her relative
      the Duchesse de Choiseul, or you would peer curiously at the view of
      Madame de Sevigné's hotel in the 'Rue Coulture St. Catherine.' Presently
      would come a patter of tiny feet, and a fat, and not very sociable, little
      dog, which had once belonged to the said Madame du Deffand, would precede
      its master, whom you would hear walking, with the stiff tread of an infirm
      person, from his bedroom on the floor above. Shortly afterwards would
      enter a tall, slim, frail-looking figure in a morning-gown, with a high,
      pallid forehead, dark brilliant eyes under drooping lids, and a friendly,
      but forced and rather unprepossessing smile. Tonton (as the little dog was
      called), after being cajoled into a semblance of cordiality, would be
      lifted upon a small sofa at his master's side, the teakettle and heater
      would arrive, and tea would be served in cups of fine old white embossed
      Japanese china. And then, the customary salutations exchanged and over,
      would gradually begin, in a slightly affected fashion, to which you
      speedily grow accustomed, that wonderful flow of talk which (like Praed's
      Vicar's)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Slipped from politics to puns,

      And passed from Mahomet to Moses,'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      that endless stream of admirably told stories, of recollections graphic
      and humorous, of sallies and <i>bons mots</i>, of which Horace Walpole's
      extraordinary correspondence is the <i>cooled</i> expression, but of the
      vivacity and variety of which, enhanced as they were by the changes in the
      speaker's voice and look, and emphasized by his semi-French gesticulation,
      it is impossible to give any adequate idea. A glance across the river
      would suggest an anecdote of her Grace the Duchess of Queensberry: a
      falling spoon, a <i>mot</i> by Lady Townshend. Upon yesterday's execution
      at Tyburn would follow a vivid picture of the deaths of Balmerino and
      Kilmarnock; or a reference to your ride from London of the night before,
      would usher in a full and particular account how the voluble and
      fascinating gentleman before you, with the great chalk stones in his
      fingers, was once all but shot through the head by the highwayman James
      Maclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, and a liberal bowl of bread-and-milk tossed out of window
      to the troops of squirrels that come flocking in from the high trees round
      the lawn, your host would invite you to make the tour of the grounds,
      adding (if it were May) that his favourite lilacs were well worth the
      effort. He would astonish you by going out in his slippers and without a
      hat; and, in reply to your ill-concealed astonishment, would laughingly
      compare himself to the Indian in the 'Spectator' who said he was 'all
      face.' Passing by the Abbot's garden, with its bright parterres, he would
      lead you to the pretty cottage he had built on the site of the old
      residence of his deceased tenant Richard Francklin, once printer of that
      scurrilous 'Craftsman' in which Pulteney and Bolingbroke had so
      persistently assailed his father. In its sunny, print-hung tea-room, with
      the 'Little Library' at the side, he would show you the picture of his
      friend Lady Hervey, once the 'beautiful Molly Lepel' of Pulteney and
      Chesterfield's ballad, and would tell you that the frame was carved by the
      same Grinling Gibbons to whom we owe the bronze statue of King James the
      Second in the Privy Garden at Whitehall. Thence you would pass to the
      chapel in the wood, with its stained-glass pictures of Henry the Third and
      his Queen from Bexhill Church, and its shrine from Santa Maria Maggiore at
      Rome; and he would explain that the roof was designed by that
      unimpeachable authority in Gothic, Mr. Chute of the Vyne, in Hampshire;
      that George Augustus Selwyn had given him the great earthen pot at the
      door; and that the carved bench in the ante-chapel had been contrived by
      no less a person than the son of the famous 'Ricardus Aristarchus,' Master
      of Trinity, the&mdash;

    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'mighty Scholiast, whose unwearied pains
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Made Horace dull, and humbled Milton's strains&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as he would quote from the 'Dunciad' of the late lamented Mr. Pope.
      Richard Bentley the younger, he would remind you, had also drawn some
      excellent illustrations to Gray (the originals of which he will show you
      later in the library); and meanwhile he invites your attention at the end
      of the winding walk to another masterpiece from the same ingenious brain&mdash;a
      huge oaken seat shaped like a shell, in which once sat together three of
      the handsomest women in England&mdash;the Duchess of Hamilton, the Duchess
      of Richmond, and the Countess of Ailesbury. If you were still
      intelligently interested, and your host still unfatigued (for he is
      capricious and easily tired), you would pass from the garden to the
      private printing-press, the 'Officina Arbuteana' as he christens it, next
      the neighbouring farmyard. Here you would be introduced to the
      superintendent and occasional secretary, Mr. Thomas Kirgate, who, if so
      minded, would exhibit to you a proof of Miss Hannah More's poem of 'Bishop
      Bonner's Ghost' (which his patron is kindly setting up for her), or then
      and there strike you off a piping-hot 'pull' of the latest quatrain to
      those charming Miss Berrys who are now inhabiting 'Little Strawberry' hard
      by, once tenanted by red-faced, good-humoured Mrs. Clive. As you return at
      last to the house, your guide would almost certainly pause in the Little
      Cloister at the entrance beside the blue and white china tub for goldfish
      in which was drowned that favourite cat whose fate was immortalized by
      Gray; and, lifting the label, he would read the poet's words:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ''T was on this lofty Vase's side,

    <p>
      Once more under Bentley's japanned tin lantern in the gloomy little hall,
      your host, pending the scribbling of half-a-dozen pressing letters' to
      Lady Ossory, Mr. Pinkerton, or one or other of his many correspondents,
      would beg you to await him in the Picture Gallery. Here, long before you
      had exhausted your admiration of the Emperor Vespasian in basalt, or the
      incomparable Greek Eagle from the baths of Caracalla, he would resume his
      post of <i>cicerone</i>, leading you almost at once to the portraits of
      his three beautiful nieces, Edward Walpole's daughters, one of whom,
      painted by Reynolds, had been fortunate enough to marry King George's own
      brother, William Henry, Duke of Gloucester (a fact of which her uncle
      Horace is ill-disguisedly proud). From the Gallery you would pass to the
      Round Drawing-Room, whose chief glory was Vasari's 'Bianca Capello;' and
      thence to the adjoining Tribune, a curious yellow-lit chamber, with
      semicircular recesses, in which were accumulated most of the choicest
      treasures of Strawberry,&mdash;miniatures by Cooper and the Olivers,
      enamels by Petitot and Zincke, gems from Italy, bas-reliefs in ivory,
      coins and seal-rings and reliquaries and filigree work, in the dispersed
      profusion of which you would afterwards dimly recall such items as a
      silver bell carved with masks and insects by Benvenuto Cellini, a missal
      attributed to Raphael, a bronze Caligula with silver eyes, and a white
      snuff-box with a portrait purporting to be a gift from Madame de Sévigné
      in the Elysian Fields, but sent in reality by the faithful Madame du
      Deffand. Each object would bring its train of associations and traditions;
      and the fading of the 'all-golden afternoon' would find your companion
      still promising fresh marvels in the yet unexplored rooms beyond, where
      are the speculum of cannel coal once used by the notorious starmonger, Dr.
      John Dee; the red hat of his Eminence Cardinal Wolsey; and the very spurs
      worn by King William the Third, of immortal memory, at the ever-glorious
      Battle of the Boyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      With four o'clock would come dinner, eaten probably in the Refectory, a
      room consecrated chiefly to the family portraits, conspicuous among which,
      in blue velvet, was your host by Richardson. The repast was 'of Attic
      taste,' but with very little wine, as Walpole himself drank nothing but
      iced water, and 'coffee upstairs' was ordered with such promptitude as to
      afford the visitor but scanty leisure for lingering over the bottle. About
      five you migrated to the Round Drawing-Room, where your entertainer, after
      recommending you to replenish your box with Fribourg's snuff from a
      canister of which the hiding-place was an ancient marble urn in the
      window-seat, would take up his station on the sofa, and resume his
      inexhaustible flood of memories and reflections, always bright, often
      striking, and never wearisome. Once, perhaps, he would rise to exhibit the
      closet he had built for Lady Di. Beauclerk's seven drawings in soot-water
      to his own tragedy of the 'Mysterious Mother;' or he would adjourn for an
      hour to the Library, to turn over his unrivalled collection of Hogarth's
      prints; or to show you Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's 'Milton,' or the
      identical 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey' from which Pope made his translations, or
      the long row of books printed at the 'Officina Arbuteana.' But he would
      gravitate sooner or later to his old vantage-ground on the sofa, whence,
      unhasting, unresting, he would discourse most excellent anecdote into the
      small hours, when the chintz curtains of the Red Bedchamber would again
      receive his bewitched and bewildered, but still unsatiated, visitor. And
      so would end your day at Horace Walpole's Gothic Castle of Strawberry
      Hill.

    <h2>
      XV. GOLDSMITH'S LIBRARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>N auctioneer's
      catalogue&mdash;and particularly an auctioneer's catalogue more than a
      hundred years old&mdash;is not, at first sight, the most suggestive of
      subjects. And yet that issued in July, 1774, by Mr. Good, of 121 Fleet
      Street, still possesses considerable interest. For it is nothing less than
      an account, bald, indeed, and only moderately literary, of the 'Household
      [sic] Furniture, with the Select Collection of Scarce, Curious and
      Valuable Books, in English, Latin, Greek, French, Italian and other
      Languages, late the Library of Dr. Goldsmith, Deceased.' As one runs over
      the items, one seems to realize the circumstances. One seems almost to see
      Mr. Good's unemotional assistants, with their pens behind their ears, and
      their ink-bottles 'upon the excise principle' dangling from their
      button-holes, as they peer about the dingy Chambers at Brick Court, with
      the dark little closet of a bedroom at the back where the poor Doctor lay
      and died. We can imagine them sniffing superciliously at the chief
      pictorial adornment, 'The Tragic Muse, in a gold frame;' or drawing from
      its sheath, with an air of 'prentice connoisseurship, 'the steel-hilted
      sword, inlaid with gold,' or 'the black-hilted <i>ditto</i>,' not without
      speculations as to how those weapons would adorn their own ungainly
      persons in a holiday jaunt to White Conduit House or Marybone Gardens. We
      see them professionally prodding the faded mahogany sofa 'covered with
      blue morine' which had so often vibrated under the nervous twitchings of
      Johnson; appraising the 'compass card-tables' over which Boswell had dealt
      trumps to Reynolds; or critically weighing the teapot in which the
      'Jessamy Bride' had more than once made tea. Their sordid commercial
      figures must have crossed and re-crossed before 'the very large
      dressing-glass' with 'mahogany frame,' which only a few weeks past had
      reflected the 'blue velvet,' and the 'straw-coloured' and 'silver-grey
      tamboured waistcoats' for which honest Mr. William Filby, at the sign of
      the Harrow in Water Lane, was never now to see the money. No doubt, too,
      they desecrated, with their Fleet Street mud, that famous Wilton carpet
      which had looked so sumptuous when it was first laid down but half-a-dozen
      years ago; and, if they were at all like their brethren of these days,
      they must have pished generally over the rest of those modest properties
      which, in the golden epoch when the 'Good Natur'd Man' seemed to promise
      perpetual prosperity, had excited so much awe and admiration among
      Goldsmith's humbler friends. 'Not much to tot up here, Docket!'&mdash;says
      Mr. Good's young man to his fellow. And we may fancy Mr. Docket assenting
      with a contemptuous extension of his under lip, enforced by the
      supplementary proposition that they should at once moisten their
      unpromising labours by adjourning to a pot of 'Parsons' Black Champagne'
      at the Tavern by the Temple Gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the books, the 'Select Collection' that the unsympathetic
      stock-takers turned over so irreverently with their feet as they lay in
      dusty ranges on the floor, it must be feared that worthy Mr. Good's
      description of them as 'Scarce, Curious and Valuable' is more creditable
      to his business traditions than his literary insight. Goldsmith was
      scarcely a book-lover in the sense in which that term is now used. The man
      who, as Hawkins relates, could tear half-a-dozen leaves out of a volume to
      save himself the trouble of transcription,&mdash;the man who underscored
      objectionable passages with his thumb-nail, as he once did to a new poem
      that belonged to Reynolds&mdash;was <i>not</i> a genuine <i>amateur du
      livre</i>. They were a 'speculative lot' in all probability, the 'Brick
      Court Library;' and no doubt bore about them visibly the bumps and bruises
      of their transit 'in two returned post chaises' to the remote farm at
      Hyde, where their owner laboured at his vast 'Animated Nature.' Many of
      them had manifestly been collected to that end. Hill's 'Fossils,' 1748;
      Pliny's 'Historia Naturalis,' 1752; Gessner and Aldrovandus 'De
      Quadrupedibus;' Gouan's 'Histoire des Poissons,' 1770; Bohadsch's 'De
      Animalibus Marinis,' 1761; De Geer's 'Histoire des Insectes,' 1771, must
      all plainly have belonged to that series of purchases for the nonce which,
      he says in his preface, had so severely taxed his overburdened resources.
      In the classics he was fairly well equipped; and, as might be expected, he
      had many of the British poets, not to mention two copies of that
      indispensable manual, Mr. Edward Bysshe his treatise of the rhyming art.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is in French literature generally, and in French minstrels and
      playwrights in particular, that his store is richest. He has the
      'Encyclopédie,' the 'Dictionnaire' and 'Recueil d'Anecdotes,' the
      'Dictionnaire Littéraire,' the 'Dictionnaire Critique, Pittoresque et
      Sentencieux,' the 'Dictionnaire Gentilhomme;' he has many of the <i>ana</i>&mdash;'Parrhasiana,'
      'Ducatiana,' 'Nau-deana,' 'Patiniana,' although, oddly enough, there is no
      copy of the 'Ménagiana,' which not only supplied him with that ancient
      ballad of 'Monsieur de la Palice' out of which grew 'Madam Blaize,' but
      also with the little poem of Bernard de la Monnoye, which he paraphrased
      so brightly in the well-known stanzas beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Say, cruel Iris, pretty rake,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Dear mercenary beauty,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      What annual offering shall I make,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Expressive of my duty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He has the works of Voltaire, Diderot, Fontenelle, Marmontel, Voiture; he
      has the plays of Brueys, La Chaussée, Dancourt, Destouches; he has many of
      the madrigalists and minor verse-men,&mdash;all of which possessions tend
      to corroborate that suspected close study of Gallic authors from which, as
      many hold, he derived not a little of the unfailing perspicuity of his
      prose, and most of the brightness and vivacity of his more familiar verse.
      Of his own works&mdash;and the fact is curious when one remembers some of
      his traditional characteristics&mdash;there are practically no examples,
      at least there is none catalogued. Their sole representative is an
      imperfect set of the 'History of the Earth and Animated Nature,' which had
      only recently been completed, and was published posthumously. Not a single
      copy of 'The Vicar,' of 'She Stoops to Conquer,' of 'The Citizen of the
      World,' of 'The Deserted Village'! Not even a copy of that rarest of
      rarities, the privately printed version of 'Edwin and Angelina,' which its
      author told his friend Cradock 'could not be amended'&mdash;although he
      was always amending it! Of course it is possible that his own writings had
      been withdrawn from Mr. Good's catalogue, or that they are included in the
      'and others' of unspecified lots. But this is scarcely likely, and it may
      be accepted as a noteworthy fact that one of the most popular authors of
      his day did not, at his death, possess any of his own performances, with
      the exception of an incomplete specimen of his most laborious
      compilation.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Racine was in similar case. In the inventory of his
     effects, discovered some time since, there is not a single
     copy of his works.
</pre>
    <p>
      Besides this, the only volumes that bear indirectly upon his work are the
      'Memoirs' of the Cardinal de Retz, which he had used in 'The Bee,' the
      'Lettres Persanes' of Montesquieu, which perhaps prompted 'The Citizen of
      the World,' and the 'Roman Comique' of M. Paul Scarron, which he had been
      translating in the latter months of its life&mdash;an accident which has
      left its mark in his last poem, the admirable 'Retaliation':
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Of old, when Scarron his companions invited,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Each guest brought his dish, and the feast was united.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that he had intended to prefix a biographical sketch or memoir
      to his version of the 'Comic Romance,' since the reference here is plainly
      to those famous picnic suppers in the Marais, to which, according to
      Scarron's biographer, M. Charles Baumet, came as guests&mdash;but * '<i>chacun
      apportant son plat</i>'&mdash;the pink of dames, of courtiers, and of men
      of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did they go, these books and household goods of 'Dr. Goldsmith,
      deceased'? It is to be presumed that he did not boast a book-plate, for
      none, to our knowledge, has ever been advertised, nor is there any record
      of one in the late Lord de Tabley's well-known 'Handbook,' so that the
      existing possessors of those precious volumes, in the absence of any
      autograph inscription, must entertain their treasures unawares. Of his
      miscellaneous belongings, the only specimens now well-known do not seem to
      have passed under the hammer of the Fleet Street auctioneer. His favourite
      chair, a dark, hollow-seated, and somewhat penitential looking piece of
      furniture, is preserved at South Kensington, where, not many years since,
      it was sketched, in company with his cane&mdash;perhaps the very cane that
      once crossed the back of Evans the bookseller&mdash;by Mr. Hugh Thomson,
      the clever young Irish artist to whom we are indebted for the most
      successful of recent illustrated editions of the | Vicar of Wakefield.' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Published by Macmillan in 1890. The sketch forms the tail-
     piece to the Preface, p. xxi.
</pre>
    <p>
      Neither chair nor cane is in the Good Catalogue, nor does it make any
      mention of the worn old wooden writing-desk which was presented to Sir
      Henry Cole's museum by Lady Hawes. Her husband, Sir Benjamin Hawes, once
      Under Secretary at War, was the grandson of William Hawes, the 'surgeon
      apothecary' in the Strand, who was called in, late on that Friday night in
      March, when the poor Doctor was first stricken down with the illness which
      a few days later terminated fatally. William Hawes, a worthy and an able
      man, who subsequently obtained a physician's degree, and helped to found
      the Humane Society, was the author of the little pamphlet, now daily
      growing rarer, entitled 'An Account of the late Dr. Goldsmith's Illness,
      so far as relates to the Exhibition of Dr. James's Powders, etc., 1774'
      [April]. He dedicated it to Burke and Reynolds; and he published it (he
      says) partly to satisfy curiosity as to the circumstances of Goldsmith's
      death, partly to vindicate his own professional conduct in the matter. His
      narrative, in which discussion of the popular nostrum upon which Goldsmith
      so obstinately relied not unnaturally occupies a considerable part, is too
      familiar for repetition; and his remarks on Goldsmith as a writer are of
      the sign-post order. But his personal testimony to the character of 'his
      late respected and ingenious friend' may fitly close this paper: 'His
      [Goldsmith's] humanity and generosity greatly exceeded the narrow limits
      of his fortune; and those who were no judges of the literary merit of the
      Author, could not but love the Man for that benevolence by which he was so
      strongly characterized.'

      XVI. IN COWPER'S ARBOUR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>MONG its many
      drawbacks controversy has this in particular, that it sometimes embroils
      us with our closest friends. Writing recently of Lord Chesterfield, * we
      found occasion to comment upon certain couplets which the poet of the
      'Progress of Error' addressed to his Lordship concerning his celebrated
      'Letters.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See ante, p. 192.
</pre>
    <p>
      What was said amounted to no more than that Cowper, in this instance at
      least, had not proved himself a Juvenal,&mdash;a sentiment which, seeing
      that his accredited biographer, Mr. Goldwin Smith, accuses him, as a
      satirist, of brandishing a whip without a lash, could scarcely be regarded
      as extravagant condemnation. Not the less, it has lain sorely upon our
      conscience. Of all the lettered figures of the eighteenth century, none is
      more dear to us than the gentle recluse of the sleepy little town by the
      Ouse. What!&mdash;the captivating letter-writer, the inventor of the
      immortal 'John Gilpin,' the delightful 'diva-gator' of the 'Task' and the
      tea-urn, the kindly proprietor of those 'canonized pets of literature,'
      Puss and Bess and Tiney&mdash;how, upon such a theme, could one excusably
      utter things harsh or censorious! It is impossible to picture him, when
      the curtains had fallen over those two windows, that looked upon the
      three-cornered market-place at Olney,&mdash;his head decorated (it may be)
      with the gaily ribboned cap which had been worked for him by his cousin
      Lady Hesketh, * his eyes milder than they seem in Romney's famous
      portrait, and placidly reading the 'Public Advertiser' to the click-click
      of Mrs. Unwin's stocking-needles,&mdash;without being smitten by a feeling
      of remorse. And opportunity for the expression of such remorse arrives
      pleasantly with an old-fashioned <i>octavo</i> which supplies the pretexts
      for a palinode in prose.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A writing-cap worn by Cowper, his watch, a seal-ring given
     to him by his eousin Theodora (his first love), and a ball
     of worsted which he wound for Mrs. Unwin, were among the
     relics exhibited in the South Gallery of the Guelph
     Exhibition of 1891. The exhibitors were the Rev. W. Cowper
     Johnson, and the Rev. W. Cowper Johnson, jun.
</pre>
    <p>
      Its title, 'writ large,' is 'Cowper, illustrated by a Series of Views, in,
      or near, the Park of Weston-Underwood, Bucks;' and it is lavishly 4
      embellished' with those mellow old plates which denote that steel had not
      yet supplanted copper. The artists and engravers were James Storer and
      John Greig, topographical chalcographers of some repute in the days of
      conventional foregrounds, and trees that look like pressed-out patterns in
      seaweed. But the 'picturesque' designs give us a good idea of the
      landscape that Cowper saw when he walked from Silver End at Olney to his
      friends the Throckmortons (the 'Mr. and Mrs. Frog' of his letters) at
      Weston House. Here is the long bridge of 'The Task,'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'That with its wearisome, but needful length,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Bestrides the wintry flood'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      between Olney and Emberton; here, bosomed in its embowering trees, the
      little farmhouse called the 'Peasant's Nest.' Here, again, in the valley,
      and framed between the feathery branches of the shrubbery, is the spire of
      Olney Church, from which one may almost fancy that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'the sound of cheerful bells .
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just undulates upon the list'ning ear;'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      here, standing out whitely from the yews and evergreens of The Wilderness,
      the urn with the epitaph of Neptune. Farther on (a lovely little
      landscape) is the clump of poplars by the water (not <i>the</i> poplars of
      the poem: those were already felled) which the poet mistook for elms; and
      here, lastly, is Cowper's own cottage at Weston, which, with its dormer
      windows, and its vines and jasmines, might have served as a model for
      Randolph Caldecott or Kate Greenaway. And, behold! ('blest be the art that
      can immortalize!') here is Mrs. Unwin in a high waist entering at the
      gate, while Cowper bids her welcome from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Olney itself there are not many glimpses in the little volume. But the
      vignette on the title-page shows the tiny 'boudoir' or summerhouse, 'not
      much bigger than a sedan chair,' which stood&mdash;nay, stands yet&mdash;about
      midway between the red-brick house on the market-place and what was once
      John Xewton's vicarage. It is still, say the latest accounts, kept up by
      its present owner, and its walls and ceiling are covered with the
      autographs of pious pilgrims. In Storer's plate you look in at the open
      door, catching, through the window on the opposite side, part of the
      parsonage and of the wall in which was constructed the gate that enabled
      Cowper at all times to communicate with his clerical friend. Its exact
      dimensions are given as six feet nine by five feet five; and he must have
      been right in telling Lady Hesketh that if she came to see him they should
      be 'as close-pack'd as two wax figures in an old-fashioned picture-frame.'
      A trap-door or loose board in the floor covered a receptacle in which the
      previous tenant, an apothecary, had stored his bottles; and here, 'in the
      deep-delved earth,' one of Cowper's wisest counsellors, the Rev. William
      Bull of Newport Pagnell, the 'Carissimus Taurorum' of the letters, the
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      'smoke-inhaling Bull,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Always filling, never full,'

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      was wont to deposit his pipes and his tobacco. 'Having furnished it with a
      table and two chairs,' says Cowper, * here I write all that I write in
      summer time, whether to my friends or the public. It is secure from all
      noise, and a refuge from all intrusion, for intruders sometimes trouble me
      in the winter evenings at Olney, but (thanks to my boudoir!) I can now
      hide myself from them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer-house, * it has been stated, is still standing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Since this paper was first written, the summer-house, the
     garden, and the 'Guinea Orchard'&mdash;a strip of field which
     came between Cowper's garden and that of the Parsonage&mdash;have
     been sold by auction, the purchaser being a local butcher.
     The sale took place in February, 1896.
</pre>
    <p>
      But of another favourite haunt of Cowper, which preceded and co-existed
      with it, there are now no traces. This was the greenhouse.
    </p>

    <p class="indent15">
      ''T is a bower of Arcadian sweets,

      he writes in his favourite rocking-horse metre, and most conventional
      language, bidding his Mary remark the beauty of the pinks which it has
      preserved through the frosts; and in mid-July, when the floor was
      carpeted, and the sun was excluded by an awning of mats, it became 'the
      pleasantest retreat in Olney.' 'We eat, drink, and sleep, where we always
      did,' he says to Newton; 'but here we spend all the rest of our time, and
      find that the sound of the wind in the trees, and the singing of birds,
      are much more agreeable to our ears than the incessant barking of dogs and
      screaming of children,' from both of which, it may be observed, they
      suffered considerably in the front of the house. Two years later he tells
      Mr. Unwin that 'our severest winter, commonly called the spring, is now
      over, and I find myself seated in my favourite recess, the greenhouse. In
      such a situation, so silent, so shady, where no human foot is heard, and
      where only my myrtles presume to peep in at the window, you may suppose I
      have no interruption to complain of, and that my thoughts are perfectly at
      my command. But the beauties of the spot are themselves an interruption,
      my attention being called upon by those very myrtles, by a double row of
      grass pinks, just beginning to blossom, and by a bed of beans already in
      bloom; and you are to consider it, if you please, as no small proof of my
      regard, that, though you have so many powerful rivals, I disengage myself
      from them all, and devote this hour entirely to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Later still&mdash;a year later&mdash;he writes to Newton: 'My greenhouse
      is never so pleasant as when we are just upon the point of being turned
      out of it. The gentleness of the autumnal suns, and the calmness of this
      latter season, make it a much more agreeable retreat than we ever find it
      in the summer; when, the winds being generally brisk, we cannot cool it by
      admitting a sufficient quantity of air, without being at the same time
      incommoded by it. But now I sit with all the windows and the door wide
      open, and am regaled with the scent of every flower, in a garden as full
      of flowers as I have known how to make it. We keep no bees, but if I lived
      in a hive, I should hardly hear more of their music. All the bees in the
      neighbourhood resort to a bed of mignonette, opposite to the window, and
      pay me for the honey they get out of it by a hum, which, though rather
      monotonous, is as agreeable to my ear as the whistling of my linnets. All
      the sounds that Nature utters are delightful, at least in this country.'
      But he goes on, nevertheless, to except the braying of an ass; and from
      another letter it seems that the serene quietude of his bower was at times
      invaded by the noise of a quadruped of this kind (inimical to poets!)
      which belonged to a neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in passing from the greenhouse to the barn that Cowper encountered
      the viper, whose prompt taking off gives motive and point to that
      admirable little <i>lusus poeticus</i>,&mdash;as Mr. Grimshawe
      condescendingly calls it,&mdash;the 'Colubriad,' and other memories
      cluster about this fragment paradise. Here 'lived happy prisoners' the two
      goldfinches celebrated in 'The Faithful Bird;' here he wrote 'The Task,'
      and, according to Mr. Thomas Wright, of Olney, it is to the stimulating
      environment of its myrtles and mignonette that we owe, if not the germ, at
      least the evolution, of 'John Gilpin.' Every one knows how, in the current
      story, Lady Austen's diverting narrative of the way in which a certain
      citizen 'of famous London town' rode out to celebrate the anniversary of
      his marriage, gradually seduced her listener from the moody melancholy
      which was fast overclouding him 'into a loud and hearty peal of laughter.'
      It 'made such an impression on his mind that at night he could not sleep;
      and his thoughts having taken the form of rhyme, he sprang from bed, and
      committed them to paper, and in the morning brought down to Mrs. Unwin the
      crude outline of "John Gilpin." All that day and for several days he
      secluded himself in the greenhouse, and went on with the task of polishing
      and improving what he had written. As he filled his slips of paper he sent
      them across the Market-place to Mr. Wilson, to the great delight and
      merriment of that jocular barber, who on several other occasions had been
      favoured with the first sight of some of Cowper's smaller poems. This
      version of the origin of "John Gilpin" differs, we are aware, from the one
      generally received, which represents the famous ballad as having been
      commenced and finished in a night; but that the facts here stated are
      accurate we have the authority of Mrs. Wilson; moreover, it has always
      been said in Olney that "John Gilpin" was written in the "greenhouse," and
      that the first person who saw the complete poem, and consequently the
      forerunner of that noble army who made merry over its drolleries, was
      William Wilson the barber.' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Wright's 'Cowper,' 1892, pp. 311, 312. Wilson was a man of
     considerable intelligence, and a local 'character.' When in
     1781 he joined the Baptists, he declined to dress Lady
     Austen's hair on Sundays. Consequently she was obliged to
     call him in on Saturday evenings, and more than once had to
     sit up all night to prevent the disarrangement of her
     'head.'

    <p>
      Cowper has been styled by a recent editor the best of English
      letter-writers, a term which Scott applied to Walpole, and it has been
      applied to others. Criticism loses its balance in these superlatives. To
      be the best&mdash;to use a schoolboy illustration&mdash;is to have the
      highest marks all round. For epistolary vigour, for vivacity, for wit, for
      humour, for ease, for simplicity, for subject&mdash;can you give Cowper
      the highest marks? The answer obviously must be 'no.' Other writers excel
      him in subject, in wit, in vigour. But you can certainly give him high
      marks for humour; and you can give him very high marks for simplicity and
      unaffectedness. He is one of the most unfeigned, most easy, most natural
      of English letter-writers. In the art of shedding a sedate playfulness
      over the least promising themes, in magnifying the incidents of his 'set
      gray life' into occurrences worthy of record, in communicating to his page
      all the variations of mood that sweep across him as he writes, he is
      unrivalled. Mandeville christened Addison a parson in a tye-wig; Cowper
      (at his best) is a humourist in a nightcap. It would be easy to select
      from his correspondence passages that show him in all these aspects&mdash;morbid
      and gloomy to Newton, genial and friendly to Hill and Unwin, confidential
      and caressing to Lady Austen and Lady Hesketh. But it is not uncommon for
      him to vary his tone to each of these, for which reason we close with an
      epistle to that austere friend and monitor who has perhaps been credited
      with a more baleful influence over his hypochondriac correspondent than is
      strictly borne out by the evidence. The reader may be told, since he must
      speedily discover it, that the following letter from Cowper to John
      Newton, like the title-page of Lowell's 'Fable for Critics,' is in rhymed
      prose:
    </p>
    <p>
      My very dear Friend,&mdash;I am going to send, what when you have read,
      you may scratch your head, and say, I suppose, there's nobody knows
      whether what I have got be verse or not;&mdash;by the tune and the time,
      it ought to be rhyme, but if it be, did you ever see, of late or of yore,
      such a ditty before?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have writ 'Charity,' not for popularity, but as well as I could, in
      hopes to do good; and if the Reviewer should say 'to be sure the
      gentleman's Muse wears Methodist shoes, you may know by her pace and talk
      about grace, that she and her bard have little regard for the taste and
      fashions, and ruling passions, and hoidening play, of the modern day; and
      though she assume a borrowed plume, and now and then wear a tittering
      air,'tis only her plan to catch, if she can, the giddy and gay, as they go
      that way, by a production on a new construction: she has baited her trap,
      and hopes to snap all that may come with a sugar plum.'&mdash;His opinion
      in this will not be amiss;'tis what I intend, my principal end, and, if I
      succeed, and folks should read, till a few are brought to a serious
      thought, I shall think I am paid for all I have said and all I have done,
      though I have run many a time, after a rhyme, as far as from hence to the
      end of my sense, and by hook or crook, write another book, if I live and
      am here, another year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard before of a room with a floor laid upon springs, and such
      like things, with so much art in every part, that when you went in you was
      forced to begin a minuet pace, with an air and a grace, swimming about,
      now in and now out, with a deal of state, in a figure of eight, without
      pipe, or string, or any such thing; and now I have writ, in a rhyming fit,
      what will make you dance, and, as you advance, will keep you still, though
      against your will, dancing away, alert and gay, till you come to an end of
      what I have penn'd, which that you may do, ere Madam and you are quite
      worn out with jigging about, I take my leave, and here you receive a bow
      profound, down to the ground, from your humble me.&mdash;W. C.

      XVII. THE QUAKER OF ART.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>BOVE the
      chimney-piece in the Study at Abbotsford, and therefore on Sir Walter's
      right-hand as he wrote, hung&mdash;nay, hangs, if we may trust the
      evidence of a photograph before us&mdash;a copy of the
      Schiavonetti-cum-Heath engraving of Thomas Stothard's once-popular
      'Canterbury Pilgrims.' With its dark oblong frame and gold
      corner-ornaments, it must still look much as it did on that rainy August
      morning described in Lockhart, when one of Scott's guests, occupied
      ostensibly with the last issues of the Bannatyne Club, sat listening in
      turn to the patter of the drops on the pane, and the 'dashing trot' of his
      host's pen across the paper to which he was then committing the first
      series of the 'Tales of a Grandfather.' The visitor (it was that acute and
      ingenious John Leycester Adolphus whose close-reasoned 'Letters to Richard
      Heber' had practically penetreated the mystery of the 'Waverley Novels')
      specially noticed the picture; and he also afterwards recalled and
      repeated a characteristic comment made upon it by Scott, with whom it was
      evidently a favourite, in one of those brief dialogues which generally
      took place when it became necessary to consult a book upon the shelves.
      Were the procession to move, remarked Sir Walter, the prancing young
      'Squire in the foreground would be over his horse's head in a minute. The
      criticism was more of the riding-school than the studio; and too much
      might easily be inferred from it as to the speaker's equipments as an
      Art-critic. For Art itself, we are told, notwithstanding his genuine love
      of landscape and natural objects, Scott cared nothing; and Abbotsford was
      rich rather in works suggestive and commemorative, than in masterpieces of
      composition and colour. 'He talked of scenery as he wrote of it,' says
      Leslie in his 'Recollections,' 'like a painter; and yet for pictures, as
      works of art, he had little or no taste, nor did he pretend to any. To him
      they were interesting merely as representing some particular scene,
      person, or event, and very moderate merit in their execution contented
      him.' Stothard's cavalcade, progressing along the pleasantly undulated
      background of the Surrey Hills, with its drunken Miller droning on his
      bagpipes at the head, with its bibulous Cook at the tail, and between
      these, all that moving, many-coloured pageant of Middle-Age society upon
      which Geoffrey Chaucer looked five hundred years ago, must have been
      thoroughly to his liking, besides reaching to a higher artistic standard
      than he required. To one whose feeling for the past has never yet been
      rivalled, such a picture would serve as a perpetual fount of memory and
      association. He must besides have thoroughly appreciated its admitted
      accuracy of costume, and it would not have materially affected his
      enjoyment if the Dick Tintos or Dick Minims of his day had assured him
      that, as a composition, it was deficient in 'heroic grasp,' or had
      reiterated the stereotyped objection that the Wife of Bath was far too
      young-looking to have buried five lawful husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original oil-sketch from which the 'Canterbury Pilgrims' was engraved,
      is now in the National Gallery, having been bought some years ago, with
      Hogarth's 'Polly Peachum,' at the dispersal of the Leigh Court Collection.
      It is not, however, by his more ambitious efforts that Stothard is most
      regarded in our day. Now and then, it may be, the Abbotsford engraving, or
      'The Flitch of Bacon,' or 'John Gilpin,' makes fitful apparition in the
      print-shop windows; now and then again, in some <i>culbute générale of the
      bric-à-brac</i> merchant, there comes forlornly to the front a card-cable
      contrived adroitly from the once famous Waterloo Shield. But it is not by
      these, or by the huge designs on the staircase at Burleigh
      ('Burleigh-house by Stamford-town'), or by any of the efforts which his
      pious biographer and daughter-in-law fondly ranked with Raphael and
      Rubens, that he best deserves remembrance. Time, dealing summarily with an
      unmanageable inheritance, has a trick of making rough and ready
      distinctions; and Time has decided, not that he did these things ill, but
      that he did other things better&mdash;for instance, book illustrations.
      And the modern collector is on the side of Time. Stothard as a colourist
      (and here perhaps is some injustice) he disregards: Stothard as a
      history-painter he disavows. But for Stothard as the pictorial interpreter
      of 'David Simple' and 'Betsy Thoughtless,' of 'The Virtuous Orphan' and
      the 'Tales of the Genii,' of 'Clarissa' and 'Sir Charles Grandison,' or
      (to cite another admirer, Charles Lamb) of that 'romantic tale'

      epithets which, in our modern acceptation of them, sound singularly
      ill-chosen, he can at least admit that if his favourite is occasionally a
      little monotonous and sometimes a little insipid, there are few artists in
      England in whose performances the un-English gift of grace is so
      unmistakably present. **

     * Coleridge is also extravagant on this theme in his 'Table
     Talk.' 'If it were not for a certain tendency to
     affectation, scarcely any praise could be too high,' he
     says, 'for Stothard's designs [to Peter Wilkins].'

     * * Strangely enough he set little more by this quality, but
     apparently valued himself more for his 'correctness' ('Bryan
     Waller Procter,' Bell, 1877, pp. 83-90).

      Fifty years ago there were but few specimens of Stothard's works in the
      Print Room of the British Museum, and even those were not arranged so as
      to be easily accessible. To-day, this complaint, which Pye makes in that
      miscellany of unexpected information, his 'Patronage of British Art,' can
      no longer be renewed. In the huge Balmanno collection, a labour of
      five-and-twenty years, the student may now study his Stothard to his
      heart's content. Here is brought together his work of all sorts, his
      earliest and latest, his strongest and his feeblest, from the first
      tentative essays he made for the 'Lady's Magazine' and Hervey's 'Naval
      History' to those final designs, which, aided by the supreme imagination
      of Turner, did so much to vitalise the finicking and overlaboured blank
      verse of his faithful but fastidious patron at St. James's Place.

      said the wicked wits of 1830; and the sarcasm has its parallel in the 'Ce
      poëte se sauve du naufrage de planche en planche,' which the Abbé Galiani
      applied to Dorât embellished by Marillier and Eisen. But Stothard did many
      things besides illustrating Samuel Rogers. Almanack heads and
      spelling-books, spoon-handles and decanter labels,&mdash;nothing came
      amiss to his patient industry. And in his book illustrations he had one
      incalculable advantage,&mdash;he lived in the silver age of
      line-engraving, the age of the Cooks and Warrens and Heaths and Findens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare and Bunyan, Macpherson and Defoe, Boccaccio and Addison,&mdash;most
      of the older classics passed under his hand. It is the fashion in
      booksellers' catalogues to vaunt the elaborate volumes he did in later
      life for the banker poet. But it is not in these, nor his more ambitious
      efforts, that the true lover of Stothard finds his greatest charm. He is
      the draughtsman of fancy rather than imagination; and he is moreover
      better in the mellow copper of his early days than the 'cold steel' of his
      decline. If you would view your Stothard aright, you must take him as the
      illustrator of the eighteenth-century novelists, of Richardson, of
      Fielding, of Sterne, of Goldsmith, where the costume in which he delighted
      was not too far removed from his own day, and where the literary note was
      but seldom pitched among the more tumultuous passions. In this
      semidomestic atmosphere he moves always easily and gracefully. His
      conversations and interviews, his promenade and garden and tea-table
      scenes, his child-life with its pretty waywardnesses, his ladies full of
      sensibility and in charming caps, his men respectful and gallant in their
      ruffles and silk stockings,&mdash;in all these things he is at home. The
      bulk of his best work in this way is in Harrison's 'Novelist's Magazine,'
      and in the old double-column edition of the essayists, where it is set off
      for the most part by the quaint and pretty framework which was then
      regarded as an indispensable decoration to plates engraved for books. If
      there be anything else of his which the eclectic (not indiscriminate)
      collector should secure, it is two of the minor Rogers volumes for which
      the booksellers care little. One is the 'Pleasures of Memory' of 1802, if
      only for Heath's excellent engraving of 'Hunt the Slipper;' the other is
      the same poems of 1810 with Luke Clennell's admirable renderings of the
      artist's quill-drawings,&mdash;renderings to rival which, as almost
      faultless reproductions of pen-and-ink, we must go right back to Hans
      Lutzelburger, and Holbein's famous 'Dance of Death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There is usually one thing to be found in Stothard's designs which many of
      his latter-day successors, who seem to care for little except making an
      effective 'compo,' are often in the habit of neglecting. He is generally
      fairly loyal to his text, and honestly endeavours to interpret it
      pictorially. Take, for example, a sketch at random,&mdash;the episode of
      the accident to Count Galiano's baboon in Sharpe's 'Gil Blas.' You need
      scarcely look at Le Sage; the little picture gives the entire story.
      There, upon the side of the couch, is the Count in an undress,&mdash;effeminate,
      trembling, almost tearful. Beside him is his wounded favourite, turning
      plaintively to its agitated master, while the hastily summoned surgeon,
      his under lip protruded professionally, binds up the injured limb. Around
      are the servants in various attitudes of sycophantic sympathy. Or take
      from a mere annual, the 'Forget-me-not' of 1828, this little <i>genre</i>
      picture out of Sterne. Our old friend Corporal Trim is moralizing in the
      kitchen to the hushed Shandy servants on Master Bobby's death. He has let
      fall his hat upon the ground, 'as if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded
      into the crown of it.' 'Are we not here now,' says Trim, 'and are we not
      gone! in a moment.' Holding her apron to her eyes, the sympathetic
      Susannah leans her hand confidingly upon Trim's shoulder; Jonathan the
      coachman, a mug of ale upon his knee, stares&mdash;with dropped chin&mdash;at
      the hat, as if he expected it to do something; Obadiah wonders at Trim;
      the cook pauses as she lifts the lid of a cauldron at the fire, and the
      'foolish fat scullion'&mdash;the 'foolish fat scullion' who 'had been all
      autumn struggling with a dropsy' and is still immortal&mdash;looks up
      inquiringly from the fish-kettle she is scouring on her knees. It is all
      there; and Stothard has told us all of it that pencil could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vestibule at Trafalgar Square is a bust of Stothard by Baily, which
      gives an excellent idea of the dignified yet deferential old gentleman,
      who said 'Sir' in speaking to you, like Dr. Johnson, and whose latter days
      were passed as Librarian of the Royal Academy. Another characteristic
      likeness is the portrait, now in the National Portrait Gallery, which was
      engraved by Scriven in 1833 for Arnold's 'Library of the Arts,' and once
      belonged to Samuel Rogers. The story of Stothard's life has little
      memorable but the work that filled and satisfied it. Placid, placable,
      unpretentious, modestly unsolicitous of advancement, labouring assiduously
      but cheerfully for miserable wage, he seems to have existed at equipoise,
      neither exalted nor depressed by the extremes of either fortune. He was an
      affectionate father and a tender husband; and yet so even-pulsed that on
      his wedding-day he went as üsual to the drawing-school; and he bore more
      than one heart-rending bereavement with uncomplaining patience. For nearly
      forty years he lived contentedly in one house (28, Newman Street) with
      little change beyond an occasional country excursion, when he would study
      butterflies for his fairies' wings, or a long walk in the London streets
      and suburbs, when he would note at every turn some new gesture or some
      fresh group for his ever-growing storehouse of imagination. It is to this
      unremitting habit of observation that we owe the extraordinary variety and
      fecundity of his compositions; to the manner of it also must be traced
      their occasional executive defects. That no two men will draw from the
      living model in exactly the same way, is a truism. But the artist, who,
      neglecting the model almost wholly, draws by preference from his
      note-book, is like a man who tells a story heard in the past of which he
      has retained the spirit rather than the details. He will give it the <i>cachet</i>
      of his personal qualities; he will reproduce it with unfettered ease and
      freedom; but those who afterwards compare it with the original will find
      to their surprise that the original was not exactly what they had been led
      to expect. In a case like the present where the artist's mind is so
      uniformly pure and innocent, so constitutionally gentle and refined, the
      gain of individuality is far greater than the loss of finish and academic
      accuracy. If to Stothard's grace and delicacy we add a certain primness of
      conception, a certain prudery of line, it is difficult not to recognize
      the fitness of that happy title which was bestowed upon him by the late
      James Smetham. He is the 'Quaker of Art.'

      1767 and 1785, travellers going southward to Newcastle along the right
      bank of the Tyne must frequently have encountered a springy, well-set lad
      walking, or oftener running, rapidly in the opposite direction. During the
      whole of that period, which begins with Thomas Bewick's apprenticeship and

      like the river in the 'Water-Babies,' and one can easily conceive with
      what an eagerness the country-bred engraver's-apprentice must have turned,
      in those weekly escapes from the great, gloomy manufacturing city, to the
      familiar sights and sounds of nature which had filled his boyhood with
      delight. To his love for these things we are indebted for his best work;
      it was his intimate acquaintance with them that has kept his memory green;
      and, even when he was an old man, they prompted some of the most effective
      passages of those remarkable recollections which, despite their <i>longueurs
      et langueurs</i>, present so graphic a picture of his early life. 'I liked
      my master,' he says; 'I liked the business; but to part from the country,
      and to leave all its beauties behind me, with which I had been all my life
      charmed in an extreme degree,&mdash;and in a way I cannot describe,&mdash;I
      can only say my heart was like to break.' And then he goes on to show how
      vivid still, at a distance of sixty years, was that first scene of
      separation. 'As we passed away, I inwardly bade farewell to the whinny
      wilds, to Mickley bank, to the Stob-cross hill, to the water-banks, the
      woods, and to particular trees and even to the large hollow old elm, which
      had lain perhaps for centuries past, on the haugh near the ford we were
      about to pass, and which had sheltered the salmon-fishers, while at work
      there, from many a bitter blast.'

      As an artist on wood, as the reviver of the then disused art of Xylography&mdash;a
      subject hedged round with many delicate and hairsplitting controversies&mdash;it
      is not now necessary to speak of Bewick. Nor need anything be said here of
      his extraordinary skills&mdash;a skill still unrivalled&mdash;in
      delineating those 'beautiful and interesting aerial wanderers of the
      British Isles,' as he styles them in his old-fashioned language, the birds
      of his native country. In both of these respects, although he must always
      be accomplished, he may one day be surpassed. But as regards his vignettes
      or tailpieces ('tale-pieces' they might be called, since they always tell
      their story), it is not likely that a second Bewick will arise. They were
      imitated in his own day; they are imitated still&mdash;only to prove once
      more how rare and exceptional is the peculiarly individual combination
      that produced them. Some of his own pupils, Luke Clennell, for instance,
      working under his eye and in his atmosphere, have occasionally trodden
      hard upon his heels in landscape; others, as Robert Johnson, have caught
      at times a reflex of his distinctive humour; but, as a rule, a Bewick
      tailpiece of the best period is a thing <i>per se</i>, unapproachable,
      inimitable, unique; and they have contributed far more&mdash;these labours
      of his play-time&mdash;to found his reputation than might be supposed. If
      you ask a true Bewickian about Bewick, he will begin by dilating upon the
      markings of the Bittern, the exquisite downy plumage of the Short-eared
      Owl, the lustrous spring coat of the Starling, the relative and
      competitive excellences of the Woodcock and the White Grouse; but sooner
      or later he will wander off unconsciously to the close-packed pathos of
      the microscopic vignette where the cruel cur is tearing at the worried
      ewe, whose poor little knock-kneed lamb looks on in trembling terror; or
      to the patient, melancholy shapes of the black and white horses seen
      vaguely through the pouring rain in the tailpiece to the Missal Thrush; or
      to the excellent jest of the cat stealing the hypocrite's supper while he
      mumbles his long-winded grace. He will tell you how Charles Kingsley, the
      brave and manly, loved these things; how they fascinated the callow
      imagination of Charlotte Brontë in her dreary moorland parsonage; how they
      stirred the delicate insight of the gentle, pure-souled Leslie; and how
      Ruskin (albeit nothing if not critical) has lavished upon them some of the
      most royal of his epithets. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. Ruskin&mdash;it may be hinted&mdash;expounding the tailpieces
     solely by the light of his intuitive faculty, has sometimes
     neglected the well-established traditional interpretations
     of Bewick's work.
</pre>
    <p>
      'No Greek work is grander than the angry dog,' he says, referring to a
      little picture of which an early proof, on the old rag-paper held by
      collectors to be the only fitting background for a Bewick, now lies before
      us. A tramp, with his wallet or poke at his side, his tattered trousers
      corded at the knees, and his head bound with a handkerchief under his
      shapeless hat, has shambled, in his furtive, sidelong fashion, through the
      open gates of a park, only to find himself confronted by a watchful and
      resolute mastiff. He lifts his stick, carved rudely with a bird's head,
      the minute eye and beak of which are perfectly clear through a magnifying
      glass, and holds it mechanically with both hands across his body, just as
      tramps have done immemorially since the days of the Dutchman Jacob Gats,
      in whose famous 'Emblems' there is an almost similar scene. The dog, which
      you may entirely cover with a shilling, is magnificent. There is not a
      line in its body which does not tell. The brindling of the back, the white
      marking of the neck and chest&mdash;to say nothing of the absolute moral
      superiority of the canine guardian to the cowering interloper&mdash;are
      all conveyed with the strictest economy of stroke. Another tailpiece, to
      which Ruskin gives the adjective 'superb,' shows a man crossing a river,
      probably the Tyne. The ice has thawed into dark pools on either side, and
      snow has fallen on what remains. He has strapped his bundle and stick at
      his back, and, with the foresight taught of necessity in those bridgeless
      days, is astride upon a long bough, so that if by any chance the ice gives
      way, or he plumps into some hidden fissure, he may still have hope of
      safety. From the bows of the moored ferryboat in the background his dog
      anxiously watches his progress. When its master is safe across, it will
      come bounding in his tracks. The desolate stillness of the spot, the
      bleak, inhospitable look of the snow-clad landscape, are admirably given.
      But Bewick is capable of even higher things than these. He is capable of
      suggesting, in these miniature compositions, moments of the keenest
      excitement, as, for example, in the tailpiece to the Baboon in the second
      edition of the 'Quadrupeds.' A vicious-looking colt is feeding in a
      meadow; a little tottering child of two or three plucks at its long tail.
      The colt's eye is turned backward; its heel is ominously raised; and over
      the North Country stile in the background a frightened relative comes
      rushing. The strain of the tiny group is intense; but as the little boy
      was Bewick's brother, who grew up to be a man, we know that no harm was
      done. Strangely enough, the incident depicted is not without a hitherto
      unnoticed parallel. Once, when Hartley Coleridge was a child, he came home
      with the mark of a horse hoof impressed unmistakably upon his pinafore.
      Being questioned, he admitted that he had been pulling hairs out of a
      horse's tail; and his father could only conclude that the animal, with
      intentional forbearance, had gently pushed him backward. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hartley Coleridge grew up to write sympathetically, in his
     papers entitled 'Ignoramus on the Fine Arts,' of these very
     tailpieces. In them, he says, Bewick is 'a poet&mdash;the silent
     poet of the waysides and hedges. He unites the accuracy and
     shrewdness of Crabbo with the homely pathos of Bloomfield.'
     (Blackwood's Magazine, October, 1831.)
</pre>
    <p>
      In describing the tailpiece to the Baboon, we omitted to mention one minor
      detail, significant alike of the artist and his mode of work. The presence
      of a strayed child in a field of flowers is not, perhaps, a matter which
      calls urgently for comment. But Bewick leaves nothing unexplained. In the
      shadow of a thicket to the left of the spectator is the negligent nurse
      who should have watched over her charge, but who, at this precise moment
      of time, is wholly engrossed by the attentions of an admirer whose arm is
      round her waist; Nor is it in those accessories alone which aid the story
      that Bewick is so careful. His local colouring is scrupulously faithful to
      nature, and, although not always an actual transcript of it, is invariably
      marked by that accuracy of invention which, as some one said of Defoe,
      'lies like truth.' Nothing in his designs is meaningless. If he draws a
      tree, its kind is always distinguishable; he tells you the nature of the
      soil, the time of year, often the direction of the wind. Referring to the
      'little, exquisitely finished inch-and-a-half vignette' of the suicide in
      the 'Birds,' Henry Kingsley (of whom, equally with his brother Charles, it
      may be said, in the phrase of the latter, <i>Il sait son Bewick</i>) notes
      that the miserable creature has hanged himself 'in the month of June, on
      an oak bough, stretching over a shallow trout stream, which runs through
      carboniferous limestone.' <i>Sero sed serio</i> is the motto which Bewick
      has written under the dilapidated, desperate figure, whose dog, even as
      the dog of Sikes in 'Oliver Twist,' is running nervously backwards and
      forwards in its efforts to reach its pendent, motionless, strangely silent
      master. These legends and inscriptions, characteristic of the artist, are
      often most happily effective. Generally, like the <i>Justissima Tellus</i>
      of the vignette of the ploughman, or the <i>Grata sume</i> of the spring
      at which Bewick himself, on his Scotch tour, is drinking from the 'flipe'
      of his hat, they simply add to the restful or rural beauty of the scene;
      but sometimes they supply the needful key to the story. In the tailpiece
      to the Woodchat, for example, a man lies senseless on the ground. His eyes
      are closed, and his hat and wig have fallen backward. Is he dead, or in a
      fit, or simply, drunk? He is drunk. On a stone hard, by is the date '4
      June, 1795,' and he has obviously been toasting the nativity of his
      Majesty George the Third.
    </p>
    <p>
      But clearness of message, truth to nature, and skill in compressed
      suggestion are not Bewick's sole good qualities. He does not seem to have
      known much of Hogarth&mdash;perhaps the Juvenalian manner of that great
      graphic satirist was not entirely to his taste&mdash;but he is a humourist
      to some extent in Hogarth's manner, and, after the fashion of his day, he
      is a moralist. He delights in queer dilemmas and odd embarrassments. Now
      it is a miserly fellow who fords a river with his cow to save the bridge
      toll. The water proves deeper than he expected; the cow, to whose tail he
      is clinging, rather enjoys it; her master does not. Now it is an old man
      at a standstill on an obstinate horse. It is raining heavily, and there is
      a high wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has lost his hat and broken his stick, but he is afraid to get down
      because he has a basket of excited live fowl on his arm. Occasionally the
      humour is a little grim, after the true North Country fashion. Such is the
      case in the tailpiece to the Curlew where a blacksmith (or is it a
      tanner?) looks on pitiless at the unhappy dog with a kettle dangling at
      its tail; such, again, in the vignette of the mischievous youngster who
      leads the blind man into mid-stream. As a moralist, Bewick is never tired
      of exhibiting the <i>lachrimo rerum</i>, the brevity of life, the
      emptiness of fame. The staved-in, useless boat; the ruined and deserted
      cottage, with the grass growing at the hearthstone; the ass rubbing itself
      against the pillar that celebrates the 'glorious victory;' the churchyard,
      with its rising moon, and its tombstone legend, 'Good Times, bad Times,
      and all Times got over,' are illustrations of this side of his genius. But
      the subject is one which could not be exhausted in many papers, for this
      little gallery is Bewick's 'criticism of life,' and he had seventy-five
      years' experience. His final effort was a ferryman waiting to carry a
      coffin from Eltringham to Ovingham; and on his death-bed he was meditating
      his favourite work. In a lucid moment of his last wanderings he was asked
      of what he had been thinking, and he replied, with a faint smile, that he
      had been devising subjects for some new Tailpieces.

      XIX. A GERMAN IN ENGLAND.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN, in 1768, the
      yet undistinguished the world his 'Journal of a Tour to Corsica,' Gray
      wrote to Horace Walpole from Pembroke College that the book had strangely
      pleased and moved him. Then, with the curious contempt for the author
      which that egregious personage seems to have inspired in so many of his
      contemporaries, Gray goes on: 'The pamphlet proves what I have always
      maintained, that any fool may write a most valuable book by chance, if he
      will only tell us what he heard and saw with veracity.' This is an
      utterance which suggests that sometimes even the excellent critic Mr.
      Gray, like the Sage of Gough Square, 'talked James Boswell of Auchinleck
      gave to laxly.' At all events this particular example scarcely illustrates
      his position. There was more than mere veracity in Boswell's method.
      Conscious or unconscious, his faculty for reproducing his impressions
      effectively, and his thoroughly individual treatment of his material, are
      far more nearly akin to genius than folly. Nor could his success be said
      to be a matter of chance, since on two subsequent occasions&mdash;in the
      'Tour to the Hebrides' and the 'Life of Johnson'&mdash;he not only
      repeated that success, but carried further towards perfection those
      fortunate characteristics which he had exhibited at first. Walpole, if we
      may trust the title-page of the 'little lounging miscellany' known as
      'Walpoliana,' reported his friend's dictum with greater moderation. 'Mr.
      Gray the poet has often observed to me, that, if any person were to form a
      Book of what he had seen and heard himself, it must, in whatever hands,
      prove a most useful and entertaining one.' As a generalisation, this
      leaves nothing to be desired. That the unaffected record of ordinary
      experiences, 'honestly set down,' is seldom without its distinctive charm,
      needs no demonstration; and when lapse of time has added its grace of
      remoteness, the charm is heightened. These considerations must serve as
      our excuse for recalling a half-forgotten 'pamphlet'&mdash;as Gray would
      have styled it&mdash;which points the moral of his amended aphorism far
      better than Boswell's 'Tour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative of Charles P. Moritz's 'Travels, chiefly on Foot, through
      several Parts of England,' belongs to 1782. It was first published at
      Berlin in 1783, and the earliest English version is dated 1795. The second
      edition (now before us) came two years later, and other issues are
      occasionally met with in booksellers' catalogues; besides which, John
      Pinkerton, the compiler of the 'Walpoliana' above mentioned, included the
      book in the second volume of his 'Collections of Voyages,' et.c., and
      Mayor also reprinted it in vol. ix. of his 'British Tourist.' *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is also included, with some omissions, in Cassell's
     excellent 'National Library.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The English translator was a 'very young lady,' said to be the daughter of
      an unidentified personage referred to by the author: the editor, who, in a
      copious preface, testifies, among other things, to the favourable
      reception of the work in Berlin and Germany generally, remains anonymous.
      Moritz himself, the writer of the volume, was a young Prussian clergyman,
      enthusiastic about England and things English, who came among us 'to draw
      Miltonic air' (in Gay's phrase), and to read his beloved 'Paradise Lost'
      in the very land of its conception. He stayed exactly seven weeks in this
      country, three of which he spent in London, the rest being occupied by
      visits to Oxford, Birmingham, the Peak, and elsewhere. What he sees, and
      what he admires (and luckily for us he admires a great deal), he describes
      in letters to one Frederic Gedike, a professorial friend at Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first communication, dated 31st May, depicts his progress up the
      Thames, which he regards as greatly surpassing even 'the charming banks of
      the <i>Elbe</i>.' Then he disembarks near Hartford, whence, with two
      companions, he posts to London, behind a round-hatted postilion 'with a
      nosegay in his bosom.' He is delighted with the first view he gets of an
      English soldier, 'in his red uniform, his hair cut short and combed back
      on his forehead, so as to afford a full view of his fine broad manly
      face.' He is interested also to see two boys engaged in the national
      pastime of boxing; and he marvels at the huge gateway-like sign-posts of
      the village inns. Passing over Westminster Bridge, he does not, like
      Wordsworth, burst into a sonnet, but he is impressed (as who would not
      be!) by that unequalled <i>coup d'oil</i>. 'The prospect from this bridge
      alone,' he says, 'seems to afford one the epitome of a journey, or a
      voyage in miniature, as containing something of everything that most
      usually occurs on a journey.' Presently, a little awed by the prodigious
      greatness and gloom of the houses (which remind him of Leipzig), he takes
      lodgings in George Street, Strand, with a tailor's widow, not very far, as
      he is pleased to discover, from that Adelphi Terrace where once 'lived the
      renowned <i>Garrick</i>.' To his simple tastes his apartments, with their
      leather-covered chairs, carpeted floors and mahogany tables, have an air
      of splendour. 'I may do just as I please,' he says, 'and keep my own tea,
      coffee, bread and butter, for which purpose [and here comes a charming
      touch of guilelessness!] my landlady has given me a cupboard in my room,
      which locks up.' With one of his landlady's sons for guide, he makes the
      tour of St. James's Park (where you may buy milk warm from the cow), and
      he experiences for the first time 'the exquisite pleasure of mixing freely
      with a concourse of people, who are for the most part well dressed and
      handsome.' His optimism finds a further gratification in the 'sweet
      security' (the expression is not his, but Lamb's) which is afforded 'from
      the prodigious crowd of carts and coaches,' by the footways on either side
      of the streets; and he explains to his 'dearest Gedike' the mysteries of
      giving the wall. He thinks London better lighted than Berlin (which
      implies little short of Cimmerian darkness in that centre of
      civilization!), and he waxes sorrowful over the general evidence of
      dram-drinking and the sale of spirituous liquors. 'In the late riots [i.e.
      the Gordon Riots of 1780], which even yet are hardly quite subsided, and
      which are still the general topic of conversation, more people have been
      found dead near empty brandy-casks in the streets, than were killed by the
      musket-balls of regiments, that were called in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing which strikes him as foreign to his experience is the
      insensibility of the crowd to funerals. 'The people seem to pay as little
      attention to such a procession, as if a hay-cart were driving past.' Among
      more pleasurable novelties, are the English custom of sleeping without an
      eiderdown, and the insular institution of 'buttered toast,' which,
      incredible as it may sound, appears to have been still an unknown luxury
      in the land of Werther. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Another of his remarks is of special interest in our day:&mdash;

     'That same influenza, which I left at Berlin, I have had the
     hard fortune again to find here; and many people die of it'
     (the italics are ours). Elsewhere he says that the Prussian
     quack Katterfelto&mdash;Cowper's=
</pre>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Katerfelto, with his hair on end.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At his own wonders wondering for his bread,'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     whose advertisements were then in every paper, attributed
     the epidemic to a minute insect, against which, of course,
     he professed to protect his patients. Walpole's
     correspondence contains references to the same visitation.
     It was, he writes, 'universal,' but not 'dangerous or
     lasting.' 'The strangest part of it,' he tells Mann in June,
     'is, that, though of very short duration, it has left a
     weakness or lassitude, of which people find it very
     difficult to recover.'
</pre>
    <p>
      On the second Sunday after his arrival he preaches at the German Church on
      Ludgate Hill for the pastor, the Rev. Mr. Wendeborn, who resides 'in a
      philosophical, but not unimproving retirement' at chambers in New Inn,&mdash;and
      he visits the Prussian Ambassador, Count Lucy, with whom, over a 'dish of
      coffee,' he has a learned argument upon the pending dispute 'about the <i>tacismus</i>
      or <i>stacismus</i>.' Then he pays à visit to Vauxhall. Comparing great
      things with small, he straightway traces certain superficial resemblances
      between the Surrey Paradise and the similar resort at Berlin,&mdash;resemblances'
      which are enforced by his speedy discovery of that chiefest glory of the
      English gardens, Roubiliac's statue of Handel. The Gothic orchestra, and
      the painted ruin's at the end of the walks (sometimes used by flippant
      playwrights as similes for beauty in decay) also come in for a share of
      his admiration; and he is particularly impressed by Hayman's pictures in
      the Rotunda. 'You here,' he adds, speaking of this last, 'find the busts
      of the best English authors, placed all round on the sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a Briton again meets with his Shakespeare, Locke, Milton, and Dryden
      in the public places of his amusements; and there also reveres their
      memory.' He finds further confirmation of this honoured position of
      letters in the popularity of the native classics as compared with those of
      Germany, 'which in general are read only by the learned; or, at most, by
      the middle class of people. The English national authors are in all hands,
      and read by all people, of which the innumerable editions they have gone
      through, are a sufficient proof.' In Germany 'since Gellert [of the
      Fables], there has as yet been no poet's name familiar to the people.' But
      in England even his landlady studies her 'Paradise Lost,' and indeed by
      her own account won the affections of her husband (now deceased) 'because
      she read Milton with such proper emphasis:'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another institution that delights him is the second-hand bookseller, at
      whose movable stall you may buy odd volumes 'so low as a penny; nay, even
      sometimes for an half-penny a piece.' Of one of these 'itinerant
      antiquaries' he buys the 'Vicar of Wakefield' in two volumes for sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Vauxhall follows, as a matter of course, a visit to the equally
      popular Ranelagh. Like most people, the traveller had expected it to
      resemble its rival, and until he actually entered the Great Room, was
      grievously disappointed. 'But,' he continues, 'it is impossible to
      describe, or indeed to conceive, the effect it had on me, when, coming out
      of the gloom of the garden, I suddenly entered a round building,
      illuminated by many hundred lamps, the splendour and beauty of which
      surpassed everything of the kind I had ever seen before. Everything seemed
      here to be round; above, there was a gallery, divided into boxes, and in
      one part of it an organ with a beautiful choir, from which issued both
      instrumental and vocal music. All around, under this gallery, are handsome
      painted boxes for those who wish to take refreshments. The floor was
      covered with mats; in the middle of which are four high black pillars,
      within which are neat fire-places for preparing tea, coffee, and punch;
      and all around also there are placed tables, set out with all kinds of
      refreshments. Within [he means 'without'] these four pillars, in a kind of
      magic rotundo, all the <i>beau-monde</i> of London move perpetually round
      and round.' This, as may be seen by a glance at Parr's print of 1751 after
      Canaletto, or the better-known plate in Stowe's 'Survey' of 1754, is a
      fairly faithful description of the Ranelagh of Walpole and Chesterfield.
      After a modest <i>consommation</i>, which, to his astonishment, he finds
      is covered by the half-crown he paid at the door, he mounts to the upper
      regions. 'I now went up into the gallery, and seated myself in one of the
      boxes there: and from thence, becoming, all at once, a grave and
      moralizing spectator, I looked down on the concourse of people who were
      still moving round and round in the fairy circle; and then I could easily
      distinguish several stars, and other orders of knighthood; French queues
      and bags contrasted with plain English heads of hair, or professional
      wigs; old age and youth, nobility and commonalty, all passing each other
      in the motley swarm. An Englishman who joined me, during this my reverie,
      pointed out to me, on my inquiring, princes, and lords with their dazzling
      stars; with which they eclipsed the less brilliant part of the company.'
      His next experiences are Of the House of Commons. Here he had like to have
      been disappointed from his unhappy ignorance of an enlightened native
      formula. Having made his way to Westminster Hall, a 'very genteel man in
      black' informed him he must be introduced by a member, an announcement
      which caused him to retire 'much chagrined.' Something unintelligible was
      mumbled behind him about a bottle of wine, but it fell on alien ears. As
      soon as he returned home, his intelligent landlady solved the difficulty,
      sending him back next day with the needful <i>douceur</i>, upon which the
      'genteel man,' with much venal urbanity, handed him into a select seat in
      the Strangers' Gallery. The building itself strikes him as rather mean,
      and not a little resembling a chapel. But the Speaker and the mace; the
      members going and coming, some cracking nuts and eating oranges, others in
      their greatcoats and with boots and spurs; the cries of 'Hear,' and
      'Order,' and 'Question,' speedily absorb him. On his first visit he is
      fortunate. The debate turns on the reward to Admiral Rodney for his
      victory over De Grasse at Guadaloupe, and he hears Fox, Burke, and Rigby
      speak. 'This same celebrated Charles Fox,' he says, 'is a short, fat, and
      gross man, with a swarthy complexion, and dark; and in general he is badly
      dressed. There certainly is something Jewish in his looks. But upon the
      whole, he is not an ill-made nor an ill-looking man: and there are many
      strong marks of sagacity and fire in his eyes.... Burke is a well-made,
      tall, upright man, but looks elderly and broken. Rigby is excessively
      corpulent, and has a jolly rubicund face.'

      Pastor Moritz repeated his visits to the Parliament House, frankly
      confessing that he preferred this entertainment to most others; and,
      indeed, it was a shilling cheaper than the pit of a theatre. When, after
      his tour in the country, he came back to London, he seems at once to have
      gravitated to Westminster, for he gives an account of the discussion on
      the Barré pension which followed the death of Lord Rockingham in July. He
      heard Fox, with great eloquence, vindicate his resignation; he heard
      Horace Walpole's friend, General Conway; he heard Burke, in a passion,
      insisting upon the respect of the house; he heard the youthful Pitt, then
      scarcely looking more than one-and-twenty, rivet universal attention. A
      little earlier he had been privileged to witness that most English of
      sights, the Westminster election in Covent Garden, with its boisterous <i>finale</i>.
      'When the whole was over, the rampant spirit of liberty, and the wild
      impatience of a genuine English mob, were exhibited in perfection. In a
      very few minutes the whole scaffolding, benches, and chairs, and
      everything else, was completely destroyed; and the mat with which it had
      been covered torn into ten thousand long strips or pieces, or strings;
      with which they <i>encircled</i> or inclosed multitudes of people of all
      ranks. These they hurried along with them, and everything else that came
      in their way, as trophies of joy; and thus, in the midst of exultation and
      triumph, they paraded through many of the most populous streets of
      London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To the British Museum he paid a flying visit of little more than an hour,
      with a miscellaneous and 'personally conducted' party,&mdash;a visit
      scarcely favourable to minute impressions. But of the Haymarket Theatre,
      to which he went twice (Covent Garden and Drury Lane being closed as usual
      for the summer months), he gives a fairly detailed account. Foote's
      'Nabob' was the play on the first night; that on the second, the 'English
      Merchant,' adapted by the elder Colman from the 'Ecossaise' of Voltaire.
      With this latter he was already familiar in its German dress, having seen
      it at Hamburg. On both occasions the performance wound up with O'Keeffe's
      once-famous ballad farce of 'The Agreeable Surprise.' That excellent
      bur-letta singer, John Edwin, took the part of 'Lingo' the schoolmaster
      (which he had created), * to the entire satisfaction of Moritz, who
      thought him, with his '<i>Amo, amas</i>, I love a lass,' etc., and his
      musical voice, 'one of the best actors of all that he had seen,'
      notwithstanding that Jack Palmer (Lamb and Goldsmith's Palmer!) acted the
      Nabob.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * There is a print of Edwin in this character after a
     picture by Alefounder. He was also a favourite 'Croaker' in
     the 'Good Natur'd Man.'
</pre>
    <p>
      But if he was pleased with the acting, he was not equally impressed by the
      audience. The ceaseless clamour of the upper gallery and the steady hail
      of missiles were anything but agreeable. 'Often and often whilst I sat
      here [i.e. in the pit], did a rotten orange, or pieces of the peel of an
      orange, fly past me, or past some of my neighbours, and once one of them
      actually hit my hat, without my daring to look round, for fear another
      might then hit me on my face.' Another passage connected with this part of
      the entertainment illustrates the old fashion of sending the lackeys to
      keep their masters' places: 'In the boxes, quite in a corner, sat several
      servants, who were said to be placed there, to keep the seats for the
      families they served, till they should arrive; they seemed to sit
      remarkably close and still, the reason of which, I was told, was their
      apprehension of being pelted, for, if one of them dares but to look out of
      the box, he is immediately saluted with a shower of orange peel from the
      gallery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the descriptions of St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey we must pass
      silently, in order to accompany the tourist on his road to Derbyshire, to
      the 'natural curiosities' of which, after some hesitation, he felt himself
      most at tracted. Equipped with a road-book, he set out by stage-coach from
      the White Hart (in the Strand) for Richmond, intending thence to pursue
      his journey on foot. According to his own account, he must have travelled
      in just such' another vehicle as that depicted in Hogarth's 'Country
      Inn-Yard,' and have shared the curiosity, so often felt by admirers of
      that veracious picture, and afterwards amply gratified in his own case, as
      to the method by which passengers managed to 'fasten themselves securely
      on the roof.' Luckily the coach met neither highwayman nor footpad. At
      Richmond he alighted, and is properly enthusiastic, almost dithyrambic,
      over 'one of the first situations in the world.' He even got up to see the
      sun rise from Richmond Hill, with the usual fate of such premature
      adventurers, a clouded sky. Then he set out on foot by Windsor to Oxford.
      But he speedily discovered that, in a horse-riding age, a pedestrian was a
      person of very inferior respectability; and though&mdash;modelling himself
      upon the Vicar of Wakefield&mdash;he was careful to invite the landlords
      to drink with him, he found himself generally treated with pity or
      contempt, which, when he sat down under a hedge to read Milton, almost
      changed into a doubt of his sanity. At most of the inns they declined to
      give him house-room, though, finally, he was allowed to enter 'one of
      those kitchens which I had so often read of in Fielding's fine novels,'
      where, just as in those novels, presently arrives a showy post-chaise to
      set the servile establishment in a bustle, although the occupants called
      for nothing but two pots of beer. After a vain attempt to obtain a night's
      lodging at Nuneham, he picks up a travelling companion in the shape of a
      young parson, who had been preaching at Dorchester and was returning to
      Oxford. His new ally takes him to the time-honoured Mitre, where he finds
      a great number of clergymen, all with their gowns and bands on, sitting
      round a large table, each with his pot of beer before him.' A not very
      edifying theological discussion ensues, which is too long to quote, and
      poor Parson Moritz is so well entertained that he has a splitting headache
      next morning. His further fortunes cannot be detailed here. From Oxford he
      goes to Stratford-on-Avon, then to Lichfield and Derby, and so to his
      destination, 'the great cavern near Castleton, in the high Peake of
      Derbyshire,' which he describes at length. He returns by Nottingham and
      Leicester, whence, still enthusiastic, but a little weary of his
      humiliations on foot, he takes coach to Northampton, mounting to the top,
      in company with a farmer, a young man and 'a black-a-moor.' This eminence
      proving as perilous as it looked, he creeps into the basket, in spite of
      the warnings of the black. 'As long as we went up hill, it was easy and
      pleasant. And, having had little or no sleep the night before, I was
      almost asleep among the trunks and the packages; but how was the case
      altered when we came to go down hill; then all the trunks and parcels
      began, as it were, to dance around me, and everything in the basket seemed
      to be alive; and I every moment received from them such violent blows,
      that I thought my last hour was come. I now found that what the black had
      told me was no exaggeration; but all my complaints were useless. I was
      obliged to suffer this torture nearly an hour, till we came to another
      hill again, when, quite shaken to pieces and sadly bruised, I again crept
      to the top of the coach, and took possession of my former seat.' No wonder
      he concludes his part of his experiences with a solemn warning to
      travellers to take inside places in English post coaches. With his return
      to London his narrative practically ends. But the rapid sketch here given
      of it affords no sufficient hint of the abundance of <i>naïf</i> detail,
      of simple enthusiasm and kindly wonderment, which characterize its pages.
      To complete the impression given, we should be able to suppose the writer
      resting contentedly from a solitary literary effort, and ending tranquil
      days as a kind of German Dr. Primrose, telling grandchildren, such as
      Chodowiecki drew, how he once saw Goldsmith's monument in the great Abbey
      by the Thames, and heard Pitt speak in the Parliament House at
      Westminster. But this is to reckon without the all-recording pages of the
      'Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie,' and that harsh resolvent, Fact. For the
      future of Pastor Charles P. Moritz was not at all in this wise. Besides
      his letters to his 'dearest Gedike,' he wrote many other works, including
      a 'psychological romance' and 'Travels in Italy;' became a Fine-Art
      Professor; married late in life, but not happily; left no family; and,
      last of all, had been dead two years when the translation which has formed
      the subject of these pages was first introduced to English readers.

      XX. OLD VAUXHALL GARDENS.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HUS sings one of
      Sylvanus Urban's poets, describing the pleasures of Spring in the London
      of George the Second. In the epithet 'happier'&mdash;an epithet probably
      suggested by the not very profound observation that the middle classes as
      a rule took their pleasure less sadly than mere persons of quality&mdash;there
      is 'the least little touch of spleen.' But the social distinction implied
      between the fashionable gardens on the Surrey side of the water and the
      more popular place of entertainment from which the tired dyer and his
      melting wife are trudging wearily in Hogarth's 'Evening' is practically
      preserved in the advertisements to be found, between May and August, in
      the newspapers of the time. Sadler's Wells is specific in its attractions,&mdash;its
      burletta or its rope-dancer: Vauxhall, on the contrary, with a disdainful
      reticence,&mdash;a <i>superbia quosita mentis</i> befitting the 'genuine
      and only Jarley,'&mdash;shortly sets forth that its 'Evening
      Entertainments' will begin on such a date; that the price of admission is
      one shilling; and that the doors will open at five. After this
      notification it continued, at rare intervals, to repeat that the gardens
      were at the service of the public; but made no more definite sign.
      Obviously the thing to do was to go. With the help of a few old pamphlets
      and descriptions, it is proposed to invite the reader to make that
      expedition, and to revive, if it may be, some memory of a place, the
      traces of which are strewn broadcast over the literature of the last
      century. It is true that Vauxhall Gardens survived to a date much later
      than this. But it was Vauxhall 'with a difference,' and the Vauxhall here
      intended is Vauxhall in its prime, between 1750 and 1790,&mdash;the
      Vauxhall of Horace Walpole and the 'Connoisseur,'&mdash;of Beau Tibbs and
      the pawnbroker's widow,&mdash;of Fielding's 'Amelia' and Fanny Burney's
      'Evelina.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1750, the customary approach to this earthly paradise was still along
      that silent highway of the Thames over which, nearly forty years before,
      Sir Roger de Coverley and Mr. Spectator had been rowed by the
      wooden-legged waterman who had fought at La Hogue. There was, indeed, a
      bridge built or being built at Westminster; but more than half a century
      was to elapse before there was another at Vauxhall. This little
      preliminary boating-party, especially to the accompaniment of French
      horns, must have been one of the delights of the journey, although, if we
      are to believe a Gallic poet who addressed a copy of verses upon 'Le
      Vauxhall de Londres' to M. de Fontenelle, '<i>le trajet du fleuve fatal</i>'
      was not without its terrors to would-be visitors. Goldsmith's Mrs. Tibbs,
      at all events, had 'a natural aversion to the water,' and when Mr. Matthew
      Bramble went, he went by coach for fear of cold, while the younger and
      bolder spirits of his party took ship from Ranelagh in 'a wherry, so light
      and slender' that, says poetical Miss Lydia Melford, they looked like
      'fairies sailing in a nutshell.' They were four in the boat, she
      nevertheless adds, beside the oarsman; and if this paper were to be
      illustrated by fancy pictures the artist's attention might be particularly
      invited to that very fantastic fairy, Mrs. Tabitha Bramble, who, we are
      told, 'with her rumpt gown and petticoat, her scanty curls, her
      lappet-head, deep triple ruffles and high stays,' was (in Lady Griskin's
      opinion) 'twenty good years behind the fashion.' What the waterman
      charged, the fair Lydia does not tell us; but he probably asked more than
      usual for so exceptional a cargo. Meanwhile, the old rates shown in the
      'Court and City Registers' of the time are moderate enough. From Whitehall
      Stairs, the favourite starting-place, the cost of a pair of oars was
      sixpence; from the Temple eightpence. For sculls you paid no more than
      half.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after passing Lambeth Palace on the left,&mdash;and possibly
      receiving from neighbouring boats some of those flowers of rhetoric to
      which Johnson once so triumphantly retorted,&mdash;you reached Vauxhall
      Stairs, your experiences were still, in all probability, those of Lydia
      Melford and her friends. There would be the same crush of wherries and
      confusion of tongues at the landing-place, and the same crowd of mudlarks
      and loafers would come rushing into the water to offer their unsolicited
      (but not gratuitous) services. Once free of these, a few steps would bring
      you to the unimposing entrance of the garden,&mdash;a gate or wicket in
      the front of an ordinary-looking house. Here you either exhibited your
      ticket, or paid your shilling; hurried, not without a throb of
      anticipation, down a darkened passage; and then, if you were as young and
      unsophisticated as Fanny Bolton in 'Pendennis,' probably uttered an
      involuntary exclamation of wonder as, with a sudden sound of muffled
      music, the many-lighted inclosure burst upon your view. There seems to be
      no doubt as to the surprise, heightened of course by the mean approach,
      and the genuine fascination of this first impression. The tall elms and
      sycamores, with the coloured lamps braced to the tree-trunks or twinkling
      through the leaves, the long ranges of alcoves with their inviting
      supper-tables, the brightly-shining temples and pavilions, the fading
      vistas and the ever-changing groups of pleasure-seekers, must have
      combined to form a whole which fully justified the enthusiasm of
      contemporaries, even if it did not, in the florid language of the old
      guide-books, exactly 'furnish the pen of a sublime and poetic genius with
      inexhaustible scenes of luxuriant fancy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The general disposition of the gardens was extremely simple and, in Miss
      Burney's opinion, even 'formal.' Opposite you, as you entered, was the
      Grand Walk, extending the entire length of the inclosure for a distance of
      900 feet, and terminated, at the farther end, by a gilded statue of
      Aurora, apparently 'tip-toe on the mountain tops.' For this was afterwards
      substituted 'a Grand Gothic obelisk,' at the corners of which were painted
      a number of slaves chained, and over them the inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Spectator
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Fastidiosus
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Sibi Molestus
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the end of this walk was a sunk-fence or <i>ha-ha</i> which
      separated the gardens from the hayfields then adjoining it. Parallel to
      the Grand Walk ran the South Walk with its triumphal arches; next to this
      again was the covered alley known indifferently as the Druid's or Lovers'
      Walk, made rather for 'whispering lovers' than for 'talking age;' and last
      came a fourth walk open at the top. Other walks, the chief of which was
      the Cross Walk, traversed the garden from side to side; and in the
      quadrangle formed by the Grand Walk, the Cross Walk, the South Walk, and
      the remaining side of the grounds, was a space of about five acres. This,
      which lay to the right of the entrance, was known as the Grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief feature of the Grove was its open-air orchestra, at first no
      more than a modest structure bearing the unambitious title of the 'rustic
      music-house.' But about 1758, this made way for a much more ornate
      building 'in the Gothic manner,' having, like its predecessor, pavilions
      beneath for the accommodation of supper-parties. Above, it contained a
      magnificent organ, in front of which, encircling an open space for the
      singers, were ranged the seats and desks of the musicians. This second
      orchestra, which was lavishly ornamented with niches and carvings, was
      surmounted by the ostrich plumes of the Prince of Wales. The decorations
      were modelled in a composition said to be known only to the 'ingenious
      architect,' a carpenter named Maidman, and the whole was painted 'white
      and bloom colour.' Immediately behind the orchestra was a building
      described as 'a Turkish tent,' with a carved blue and gold dome supported
      on eight internal Ionic, and twelve external Doric columns. This was
      profusely embellished, both within and without, by rich festoons of
      flowers. A good idea of the orchestra in its renovated form may be
      gathered from a little plate by Wale, in which the supper-tables are shown
      laid out in front. These for a long time were covered with red baize, an
      arrangement that added greatly to the general effect, which was further
      enhanced by arches of coloured lamps and other contrivances. There is a
      tinted design by Rowlandson&mdash;one indeed of his most popular efforts&mdash;depicting
      a motley group in front of the orchestra during the performance of Mrs.
      Weichsell, and numbering among the crowd of listeners the Prince of Wales,
      'Perdita,' the Duchess of Devonshire, Lady Duncannon, and other
      distinguished personages. In a supper-box at the side are Johnson,
      Boswell, Goldsmith, and Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musical performances in the orchestra generally began at six. At first
      they were wholly instrumental, and confined to 'sonatas and concertos.' In
      time, however, songs were added to the programme; and later still these
      were diversified by catches and glees, which generally came in the middle
      and at the end of the sixteen pieces to which the entertainment was
      restricted. Before the introduction of glees and catches, it was the
      practice to wind up with a duet or trio, accompanied by a chorus. In the
      old Vauxhall song-books may be studied the species of lyric which was
      trilled or quavered nightly from the Gothic aviary in the Grove. There is
      not much variety in these hymns to 'Jem of Aberdovey' or 'Kate of
      Aberdare, and the prevailing tone is abjectly sentimental. A favourite
      form was the 'Rondeau,' a much more rudimentary production than the little
      French plaything now known by that name, and characterized chiefly by its
      immoderate use of the refrain.

      This is the artless burden of one of the 'celebrated Roundelays' sung at
      Vauxhall by the celebrated Mrs. Bland (<i>blandior Orpheo!</i>) to the
      music of the equally celebrated Mr. James Hook; and the 'young Shepherd by
      Love sore opprest, When the Maid of his heart he fondly addrest,' can
      scarcely be acquitted of needless iteration. But the music was often of a
      much higher kind, and the beautiful Shakespearean songs of Dr. Arne, 'When
      daisies pied,' and 'Where the bee sucks,' or 'Water parted' from the same
      composer's Opera of 'Artaxerxes,' alternated occasionally with the more
      popular ditties which delighted the average listener. Hook (the father of
      Theodore Hook), who was organist for upward of forty years, and Arne, who
      often conducted, were the most assiduous composers. Among the female
      singers were many vocal celebrities of the last century,&mdash;Mrs.
      Vincent and Miss Brent (of whom Goldsmith writes in 'The Bee' and 'The
      Citizen of the World'); the before-named Mrs. Weichsell, fair mother of
      the fairer Mrs. Billington; Mrs. Mountain; and for men, Lowe, Denman,
      Vernon, the 'great Dignum,' and the famous tenor Beard, whose name,
      together with that of one of his gentler colleagues, survives in
      Churchill's hectoring couplets:

      The broad-shouldered poet of the 'Rosciad' and the 'Apology,' it may be
      added, was himself one of the constant frequenters of the garden, where he
      was wont to appear, not in clerical black, as in the pit of Drury Lane,
      but resplendent in a blue coat, white silk stockings, silver shoe-buckles,
      and a gold-laced hat.

      The 'native notes' of the orchestra, however, could only be comfortably
      enjoyed in fine weather. When it rained,&mdash;and the eighteenth century
      had no immunity in this respect,&mdash;the company, like Mr. Bramble, took
      shelter in the Rotunda. This was a large circular saloon, entered through
      a colonnade to the left of the Grand Walk. It was freely furnished with
      busts, mirrors, sconces, and the like. But its chief glory was its roof,
      known popularly as 'the Umbrella,' and specially constructed for musical
      purposes. Profusely ornamented with gilding and festoons, it seems to have
      presented something of the appearance of a large fluted shell. When the
      'new music room,' as it was at first called, was erected, the organ and
      orchestra it contained fronted the entrance through the colonnade in the
      Grove. By-and-by these were moved to the left, so as to face a new room
      which was added to the Rotunda, and ran forward into the garden at the
      back of the colonnade, parallel to the Grove. This room, supported by
      elaborate columns, and lighted from two cupolas painted with gods and
      goddesses, must have added materially to the attractions of the Rotunda,
      when entered through it. In course of time, the spaces between the side
      columns were filled with large pictures representing national subjects,
      from the brush of Hogarth's friend, the history painter, Frank Hayman. In
      one, Britannia distributed laurels to Lord Granby and other distinguished
      officers; in another, Clive received the homage of the Nabob; in the
      third, Neptune rejoiced over Hawke's victory of 1759. But the best known,
      and the first finished of the group&mdash;it was exhibited in 1761&mdash;was
      the surrender of Montreal to Amherst. Whether copies of these still exist
      we know not; but, to judge from its effect upon Pastor Moritz, this last,
      at all events, must have had its merits.*

      'Among the paintings,' he says, 'one represents the surrender of a
      besieged city. If you look at this painting with attention for any length
      of time, it affects you so much that you even shed tears. The expression
      of the greatest distress, even bordering on despair, on the part of the
      besieged, the fearful expectation of the uncertain issue, and what the
      victor will determine concerning those unfortunate people, may all be read
      so plainly and so naturally in the countenances of the inhabitants who are
      imploring for mercy, from the hoary head to the suckling whom his mother
      holds up, that you quite forget yourself, and in the end scarcely believe
      it to be a painting before you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The new room was entered through a Gothic portal or temple, which
      contained portraits of George the Third and Queen Charlotte, and also
      formed the starting-point of a semicircular piazza or colonnade that swept
      round to a similar terminal temple at the end of the arc. Between these
      two, in the middle of the semicircle, was a higher central structure
      denominated in old prints the Temple of Cornus. This is said, rather
      vaguely, to have been 'embellished with rays,' and had above it a large
      star or sun, which, from the description, would seem to have been
      illuminated at night. Inside, it was painted with a composition 'in the
      Chinese taste' representing Vulcan catching Mars and Venus in the
      historical net, the painter being named (not inappropriately) Risquet. The
      two pavilions or alcoves immediately adjoining also contained pictures. To
      the right a lady and gentleman were shown entering Vauxhall; to the left
      was a presumably emblematic design of 'Friendship on the grass, drinking.'
      Other boxes fitted for the accommodation of supper-parties, but having no
      pictorial decorations, extended on either side of the Temple of Cornus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the terminal temples, one, as already stated, served as the porch to
      the new room; its fellow at the farther end ultimately formed the entrance
      to a famous and popular entertainment referred to in a former paper, * and
      known indifferently as the 'Waterworks' or the 'Cascade.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      Some of the earlier references to this, or to its earliest form, are more
      or less contemptuous, as the 'World,' the 'Connoisseur,' and the 'Gray's
      Inn Journal' all speak of it slightingly as the 'Tin Cascade.' But, as
      time went on, it must have been greatly improved. Here is Moritz's
      description of it in 1782: 'Lateish in the evening [i.e. about nine
      o'clock], we were entertained with a sight, that is indeed singularly
      curious and interesting. In a particular part of the garden, a curtain was
      drawn up, and by means of some mechanism, of extraordinary ingenuity, the
      eye and the ear are so completely deceived, that it is not easy to
      persuade one's-self it is a deception; and that one does not actually see
      and hear a natural waterfall from an high rock.' The next sentence adds a
      characteristic detail: 'As every one was flocking to this scene in crowds,
      there arose all at once, a loud cry of "Take care of your pockets." This
      informed us, but too clearly, that there were some pick-pockets among the
      crowd, who had already made some fortunate strokes.' Ten years later
      still, many other details and effects must have been added, since the
      descriptions speak of representations of trees blown by the wind, of
      thatches torn off, of wagons and troops of soldiers crossing bridges, etc.
      By this time, in fact, it was a monster 'moving picture,' of the kind
      which Pinchbeck and Fawkes were in the habit of exhibiting at Bartholomew
      Fair. But in Goldsmith's day it was still in the elementary stage
      described by Sylvanus Urban in August, 1765, that is to say, it exhibited
      'a beautiful landscape in perspective, with a miller's house, a
      water-mill, and a cascade.' At the proper moment this last presented the
      exact appearance of water flowing down a declivity, rising up in a foam at
      the bottom, and then gliding away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the terminal temple which served as the approach to the water-works
      a sweep of pavilions led back to the Grand Walk. In the last of these was
      a picture of Gay's 'Black-Eyed Susan,' taken apparently at that affecting
      moment when, returning to shore from her faithful William, she 'waved her
      lily hand.' A little higher the Grand Walk was intersected at right angles
      by the Grand Cross Walk, which, as already stated, traversed the gardens.
      To the right this was terminated by the Druid's Walk and a statue of
      Apollo; to the left, by one of the 'favourite illusions of the place, a
      large painting representing ruins and running water. In this part of the
      garden, as far as it is possible to make it out from the descriptions,
      extending on the left towards the bottom, were, on one side, a Wilderness,
      on the other Rural Downs 'with several little eminences... after the
      manner of a Roman camp.' These were 'covered with turf, and pleasingly
      interspersed with cypress, fir, yew, cedar, and tulip trees.' On one of
      these heights, the attentive spectator soon discovered, like Pastor
      Moritz, the statue (in lead) of Milton which the guide-books attribute to
      Roubiliac. At night this statue was lighted with lamps. From the downs,
      say the old guide-books, you had a good view of Lambeth, Westminster, and
      St. Paul's. It was in this part of the garden also, from some of the
      bushes of the Roman camp, that proceeded the subterranean entertainment
      known as the 'Fairy Music.' But this 'lodging on the eold ground,'&mdash;to
      quote the old Caroline song,&mdash;was found 'prejudicial to the
      instruments,' probably also to the instrumentalists, and it was eventually
      discontinued.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, turning your back upon the picture of ruins and running water, you
      followed the Cross Walk behind the pavilions which formed the north side
      of the Grove, you came upon the South Walk, which ran parallel to the
      Grand Walk. The speciality of this promenade was its 'three splendid
      triumphal arches.' The vista through these arches was, at first, closed by
      a pictorial representation of the Ruins of Palmyra. But the simulated
      ruins themselves grew ruinous, and finally made way for 'a noble view of
      architecture designed by Sand by [no doubt the brother of Hogarth's
      opponent], and painted by Mortimer.' At night the same painter's work was
      exhibited in the form of an illuminated transparency. Where the South Walk
      ran parallel to the right side of the Grove was a further range of
      pavilions, part of which formed a semicircle shaded in front by lofty
      trees. In the centre of this semicircle stood, for some time, the cynosure
      of Vauxhall, L. F. Roubiliac's statue of Handel, rather less than
      life-size, in the character of Orpheus playing on his lyre. It was,
      however, frequently moved; and its different positions are a source of
      considerable mystification to the student of the old prints of the place.
      In 1774, according to Smith's 'Nollekens,' it had its habitat 'under an
      inclosed lofty arch, surmounted by a figure [of Saint Cecilia] playing the
      violoncello, attended by two boys; and it was then screened from the
      weather by a curtain, which was drawn up when the visitors arrived.' In
      Canaletto's view of six years later it is disporting itself in the open,
      as above described; but after the new Gothic orchestra was erected, it
      seems to have returned to its original retreat, and later still had found
      an asylum in a new supper-room which was added to the Rotunda. Rartolozzi
      is credited with a fine engraving of this statue, which was reputed to be
      the first original work Roubiliac carved in England. It did not always
      remain at Vauxhall, and ultimately passed into the keeping of the
      descendants of the proprietor of the garden, where, at present, we need no
      further follow its fortunes. *

    <p>
      As already stated, each of the four sides of the quadrangle which enclosed
      the Grove was occupied by pavilions, alcoves, or booths fitted up for the
      accommodation of supper-parties. These were of varying importance, since
      we are expressly informed, in 'The Citizen of the World,' that some were
      more 'genteel' than others, and that those in that 'very focus of public
      view' affected by Goldsmith's Beau and his lady, were appropriated more or
      less by persons of position. The one that fronted the Orchestra was larger
      than the rest, having been specially built for Frederick, Prince of Wales.
      It was decorated by Hayman with paintings from 'The Tempest,' 'King Lear,'
      'Macbeth,' and 'Henry the Fifth,' and had behind it a handsome
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention of the decorations in the Prince of Wales's pavilion recalls
      one of the historical attractions of the gardens,&mdash;the pictures in
      the other supper-boxes. At night-time each of these was 'enlightened to
      the front with globes;' and a story, which has always seemed to us a
      little indefinite, traces the first suggestion of them to Hogarth. But one
      of the earliest and most trustworthy of the guides&mdash;the 'Sketch of
      the Spring Gardens, Vauxhall: In a Letter to a Noble Lord'&mdash;implies
      that Hayman was the true originator in this matter. It is certain,
      however, that Hogarth contributed specimens of his own works to the cause,
      and that others were copied. According to his first annotator, Nichols,
      Dayman reproduced the 'Four Times of the Day' for Vauxhall; and in 1782
      two of these, 'Evening' and 'Night,' were still there, and must have been
      seen by Moritz; while in the portico of the Rotunda was an unquestioned
      picture from Hogarth's own brush, Henry the Eighth and Anne Boleyn,&mdash;names
      which, it was popularly whispered, but thinly veiled the likenesses of
      Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his mistress, Anne Vane, not to be
      confused with the notorious 'Lady of Quality' of the same surname in
      Smollet's 'Peregrine Pickle.' Another work claimed as Hogarth's when,
      years after, obscured by dirt and slashed by sandwich knives, the relics
      of the little gallery came to the hammer, was Harper and Mrs. Clive (then
      Miss Raftor) as 'Jobson the Cobbler' and his wife 'Nell' in Coffey's farce
      of 'The Devil to pay; or, the Wives Metamorphosed;' but this, as well as a
      nautical <i>genre</i> picture called 'The Wap-ping Landlady,' is plainly
      attributed to Hayman in the contemporary prints of Sayer. It is probable
      also that Hayman had the chief hand in 'Mademoiselle Catherina,' a
      diminutive lady whose history has escaped the chroniclers, and 'Building
      Houses with Cards,' although the two children in the latter have certainly
      a look of his more illustrious contemporary. But, on the whole, it may be
      concluded that there was little of Hogarth's original work among the
      sea-fights, popular games (e.g. the time-honoured pastimes of 'Bob Cherry'
      and 'Hot Cockles'), and other engaging compositions which delighted the
      simple soul of the pawnbroker's widow and disgusted the eclectic Mr.
      Tibbs, full of Grisoni and the grand contorno. Hogarth's picture in the
      Rotunda portico, coupled with his permission to reproduce his other works,
      would, however, be ground enough to justify the gold ticket <i>In
      perpetuam Beneficii memoriam</i> with which he was presented by the
      grateful proprietor. This ticket, which admitted 'a coachful,' that is,
      six persons, was, in 1808, in the possession of Mrs. Hogarth's cousin,
      Mary Lewis, in whose arms the painter died. It had passed to fresh hands
      in 1825, when, with other silver passes, all said to be struck from
      Hogarth's designs, and including among the rest that of George Carey, the
      author of many Vauxhall songs, it was engraved for the 'Londina
      Illustrata' of Wilkinson.

    <p>
      The greater part of the literary memories of Vauxhall Gardens cluster
      round these gaily painted boxes from which, at some moment of their
      careers, most of the notabilities of the day had taken their view of
      'many-coloured life.' Churchill we have already seen there in his habit as
      he lived; and Collins is said to have divided his attentions between
      Vauxhall and the play-houses. Goldsmith and Reynolds, we know, were
      frequent visitors; Johnson, according to Dr. Maxwell (and in spite of
      Rowlandson), was more partial to Ranolagh. It is in Vauxhall's 'proud
      alcoves' that Fielding places one of the scenes of 'Amelia;' prefacing it
      with a handsome compliment to the extreme 'elegance' and 'beauty' of the
      place. The account of the rudeness which his heroine and her party
      suffered from Captain Trent and his companions is scarcely separable from
      its context, although it conveys a graphic idea, confirmed by other
      records, of the annoyances to which the more peaceable visitors were
      occasionally exposed at the hands of the Georgian man-about-town. But
      there is a pen-and-ink picture in Colman and Thornton's 'Connoisseur'
      which, although mainly levelled at the exorbitant prices of provisions,
      may be taken to depict pretty accurately the humours of an ordinary
      middle-class family at Vauxhall. Mr. Rose, a tradesman, his wife, and his
      two daughters, make the turn of the place, and then sit down to supper.
      'Do let us have a chick, papa,' says one of the young ladies. Papa replies
      that 'they are half a crown apiece, and no bigger than a sparrow.'
      Thereupon he is very properly rebuked by his wife for his stinginess.
      'When one is out upon pleasure,' she says, 'I love to appear like
      somebody; and what signifies a few shillings once and away, when a body is
      about it?' So the chick is ordered, and brought. And then ensues a
      dialogue between the cit and the waiter, in which the former, from the
      price of the sample before him, ironically estimates the price of an
      entire Vauxhall ham to be about £24, and after being decorated by his wife
      with a coloured handkerchief by way of bib, proceeds to eat, saying at
      every mouthful, 'There goes twopence, there goes threepence, there goes a
      groat.' Beef and cheese-cakes, which are also freely commented upon,
      follow, and finally Mr. Rose calls for a bottle of port, the size of which
      does not escape invidious comparison with the more generous vessels of the
      Jerusalem Coffee House, although the contents have the effect of soothing
      the critic into the unwonted extravagance of a second pint. Then, after
      the old lady has observed upon the rudeness of the gentlemen, who stare
      her out of countenance with their spy-glasses, and the younger girl is
      speculating whether, if she | buys the words of the last new song, she can
      carry home the tune, arrives the reckoning, which is exactly thirteen
      shillings and twopence. The last glimpse we get of the little party shows
      them leaving the gardens in a shower, Madam with her upper petticoat
      thrown over her head, her daughters with turned-up skirts, and
      Paterfamilias with his flapped hat tied round with a pocket handkerchief,
      his coat buttoned to save his lace waistcoat, and his wife's cardinal
      spread wrong side out over his shoulders to save his coat. Thus they sally
      out to their hack&mdash;he lamenting half humorously, half ruefully, that
      he might have spent his evening at Sot's Hole for fourpence halfpenny,
      whereas Vauxhall, with the coach hire, will have cost him 'almost a
      pound.' In the 'Wits' Magazine' for 784, you may see the whole group
      depicted to the life after the broad, ungentle fashion of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the cost of the refreshments was a fertile topic of discussion is, to
      cite but one of many witnesses, confirmed by Miss Burney in 'Evelina;' and
      the popular legend that an expert Vauxhall carver could cover the entire
      garden (about eleven acres) with slices from one ham, may be accepted as
      corroborative evidence. Old frequenters, indeed, pretended to remember the
      particular angle at which the plates had to be carried to prevent their
      leaf-like contents from becoming the plaything of the winds. But the above
      picture from the 'Connoisseur,' it must be noted, is a picture of the
      occasional visitor,&mdash;the visitor who made but one annual visit, which
      was the event of the year. The main supporters of the place were the
      persons of quality, of whom Walpole gossips so delightfully in his
      correspondence; and it is to his pages that one must go for a faithful
      representation of High Life at Vauxhall. In one of his letters to George
      Montagu, he describes, with his inimitable air of a fine gentleman on a
      frolic, a party of pleasure at which he has assisted, and which (he
      considers) exhibits 'the manners of the age.' He tells how he receives a
      card from Lady Caroline Petersham (the Duke of Grafton's daughter) to go
      with her to Vauxhall. Thereupon he repairs to her house, and finds 'her
      and the little Ashe, or the Pollard Ashe, as they call her,' having 'just
      finished their last layer of red, and looking as handsome as crimson can
      make them.' Others of the company are the Duke of Kingston, Lord March of
      Thackeray's 'Virginians,' Mr. Whitehed, 'a pretty Miss Beauclcre, and a
      very foolish Miss Sparre.' As they 'sail up the Mall,' they encounter
      cross-grained Lord Petersham (my lady's husband), 'as sulky as a ghost
      that nobody will speak to first,' and who declines to accompany his wife
      and her friends. So they march to their barge, which has 'a boat of French
      horns attending,' and 'little Ashe' sings. After parading up and down the
      river, they 'debark' at Vauxhall, where at the outset they narrowly escape
      the excitement of a duel. For a certain Mrs. Lloyd of Spring Gardens
      (afterwards married to Lord Haddington), seeing Miss Beauclerc and her
      companion following Lady Petersham, says audibly, 'Poor girls, I am sorry
      to see them in such bad company,' a remark which 'the foolish Miss Sparre'
      (she is but fifteen), for the fun of seeing a duel, endeavours to make
      Lord March resent. But my Lord, who is 'very lively and agreeable,' laughs
      her out of 'this charming frolic with a great deal of humour.' 'At last,'
      says Walpole,&mdash;and here we may surrender the story to him entirely,&mdash;'we
      assembled in our booth, Lady Caroline in the front, with the vizor of her
      hat erect, and looking gloriously jolly and handsome. She had fetched my
      brother Orford from the next box, where he was enjoying himself with his
      <i>petite partie</i>, to help us to mince chickens. We minced seven
      chickens into a china dish, which Lady Caroline stewed over a lamp, with
      three pats of butter and a flagon of water, stirring, and rattling, and
      laughing, and we every minute expecting to have the dish fly about our
      ears. She had brought Betty [Neale] the fruit girl, with hampers of
      strawberries and cherries from Rogers's, and made her wait upon us, and
      then made her sup by us at a little table. The conversation was no less
      lively than the whole transaction. There was a Mr. O'Brien arrived from
      Ireland, who would get the Duchess of Manchester from Mr. Hussey if she
      were still at liberty. I took up the biggest hautboy in the dish, and said
      to Lady Caroline, "Madam, Miss A he desires you would eat this O'Brien
      strawberry;" she replied immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't, you hussey." You may imagine the laugh this reply occasioned.
      After the tempest was a little calmed, the Pollard said, "Now, how anybody
      would spoil this story that was to repeat it and say, I won't, you jade!"
      In short, the whole air of our party was sufficient, as you will easily
      imagine, to take up the whole attention of the garden; so much so, that
      from eleven o'clock till half an hour after one we had the whole concourse
      round our booth; at last they came into the little gardens of each booth
      on the sides of ours, till Harry Vane took up a bumper and was proceeding
      to treat them with still greater freedom. It was three o'clock before we
      got home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this 'frisk' in good society included the passage of the Dark
      Walk, the chronicler has not related. But the Dark Walk, also known as the
      'Druid's,' or 'Lovers' Walk,' is almost the only feature of the gardens
      which now needs to be described. Its position has already been roughly
      indicated. It was formed by tall overarching trees meeting at the top, in
      which, in the place's palmiest days, blackbirds, thrushes, and
      nightingales made their nests. A visit to this <i>selva oscura</i> was the
      prime ambition of the more inquiring visitor to Vauxhall, either upon the
      simple ground put forward by the elder Miss Rose in the 'Connoisseur' that
      it was '<i>solentary</i>,' or upon the more specious excuse, advanced by
      the generality, that the music of the Orchestra sounded better through the
      thick foliage of the trees. But the pretexts for seeking these attractive
      shades were probably as inexhaustible as Dean Aldrich's reasons for
      drinking, the last of which was 'any other reason.' In Miss Burney's
      'Evelina,' that delightful heroine is decoyed into the Dark Walk by her
      vulgar friends, the Branghtons.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she is insulted by a gang of rakes, and is rescued by Sir Clement
      Willoughby, who, apparently under the influence of the genius of the
      place, proceeds, after certain impertinences, to make her a spasmodic
      declaration, plentifully punctuated with dashes in this wise,&mdash;'O
      Miss Anville,&mdash;loveliest of women,&mdash;forgive me,&mdash;my&mdash;I
      beseech you forgive me;&mdash;if I have offended&mdash;if I have hurt you,&mdash;I
      could kill myself at the thought!' etc. Thus this 'most impetuous of men;'
      and thus did they make love in Vauxhall's 'green retreats' 'when George
      was king.' Nor love alone, apparently; for if the old descriptions are
      strictly accurate in representing some of its frequenters as yelling 'in
      sounds fully as terrific as the imagined horrors of Cavalcanti's
      bloodhounds,' there must have been a considerable amount of more than
      questionable horse-play besides; and the licensing magistrates who, in
      1763, bound the proprietors to do away with the 'dark walks,' and to
      appoint proper watchmen, were no doubt well advised.

      From the use of the plural 'walks,' it may be that the prohibition also
      included the numerous wildernesses which occupied the north of the
      inclosure,&mdash;wildernesses so intricate that, even in the prehistoric
      era of the place, the most experienced mothers&mdash;to use the expressive
      words of Tom Brown 'of facetious memory'&mdash;often 'lost themselves in
      looking for their daughters.' And this brings us to the final item in our
      catalogue, the walk which bounded the garden on the north, closing and
      terminating the four great promenades that traversed it from top to
      bottom. This, shaded like the rest by trees, had at each end one of the
      favourite 'scenes.' That to the east was a view in a Chinese garden; that
      to west, a building with a scaffold and a ladder before it, which at a
      distance 'often deceived the eye very agreeably.' History has neglected
      the artist of these ingenious performances. But Hayman had begun with
      stage decoration, and may perhaps have executed them. Or they may have
      been from the brush of George Lambert, the well-known scene-painter of
      Covent Garden, who, like Hayman, was a friend of Hogarth, and is reported
      to have borne his part in the beautifying of the place.

    <p>
      In the foregoing sketch we have endeavoured to revive some specific idea
      of the aspect of a forgotten place of amusement, rather than to produce
      that indefinite patchwork of anecdote which, with a judicious sprinkling
      of shoe buckles and periwigs, of hoops and gipsy-hats, so often does duty
      for 'a picture of the time.' But a last word must certainly be devoted to
      the proprietor and presiding spirit, Jonathan Tyers. Little seems to be
      known of him before he acquired the site of the old Spring Garden of the
      'Spectator' in March, 1728, from one Elizabeth Masters, of London, upon a
      thirty years' lease. Even then it must have had many of the appurtenances
      of a public resort, for the deed enumerates a Ham-room and a Milk-house,
      and there were already primitive alcoves in the shape of tiled arbours
      entitled Royal George, Ship, Eagle, Phoenix, Checker, and the like. Nay,
      there were already lofty trees which dated from the seventeenth century
      and the days of an earlier possessor, the Sir Samuel Morland of Pepys's
      Diary. The rent whieh Tyers paid was £250. He added music; then by degrees
      the orchestra and organ, the statues, the pictures, and the other
      adornments. He opened the garden in June, 1732, with illuminations and a
      <i>Ridotto al' fresco</i>, at which Frederick, Prince of Wales, was
      present; and the company, numbering four hundred, wore masks, dominoes,
      and lawyers' gowns. Order was kept by a detachment of footguards, and the
      admission ticket was designed by Jack Laguerre, son of the Louis whose
      muscular saints sprawl, in Pope's verse, upon the ceilings of 'Timon's
      Villa.' Payment was subsequently made at the gate; but in 1738, apparently
      with a view to render the attendance somewhat more select, a thousand
      silver season tickets were issued. In 1752 Tyers purchased part of the
      estate out and out, and a few years afterwards acquired the remainder. To
      the last day of his life he retained the keenest interest in the place,
      and only a few hours before his death caused himself to be carried into
      the gardens to take a parting look at them. At his country-seat of Denbies
      near Dorking in Surrey, he had another private garden, in the
      embellishment of which he must have found an outlet for some otherwise
      obstructed eccentricity, since it contained a representation of the Valley
      of the Shadow of Death, where, in an alcove, had been depicted, in two
      compartments, the ends of the infidel and the Christian. According to the
      'Gentleman's Magazine,' Tyers passed through the Valley himself in July,
      1767. His descendants long continued to manage Vauxhall Gardens. Perhaps
      the most notable of these was his eldest son Tom, the friend and
      biographer of Johnson, and the 'Tom Restless' of the 'Idler.'

      XXI. AT LEICESTER FIELDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is with places
      as with persons: they often attract us more in their youth than in their
      maturer years Apart from the fact that these papers are confessedly
      confined to the Eighteenth Century, this threadbare truth affords a
      sufficient excuse for speaking of Leicester Square by its earlier, rather
      than by its existing name. And, indeed, the abiding interest of the
      locality lies more in the past than in the present. Not even the addition
      to the inclosure of busts and a Shakespeare fountain, has been able to
      regenerate entirely the Leicester Square that most of us remember, with
      its gloomy back streets,&mdash;its fringe of dingy <i>cafés</i> and <i>restaurants</i>,&mdash;its
      ambiguous print and curiosity shops,&mdash;its incorrigibly unacclimatized
      Alhambra, whose garish Saracenic splendours scale and peel perpetually in
      London's <i>imber edax</i>. If we call anything forcibly to mind in
      connection with the spot, it is a certain central statue, long the mock of
      the irreverent,&mdash;a statue of the first George, which had come of old,
      gilded and magnificent, from 'Timon's Villa' at Canons, to fall at last
      upon evil days and evil tongues, to be rudely spotted with sacrilegious
      paint, to be crowned with a fool's cap, and, finally, to present itself to
      the spectator in the generally dishonoured and dilapidated condition in
      which, some twenty years ago, it was exhibited by the late John O'Connor
      on the walls of the Royal Academy. But when, travelling rapidly backwards,
      past the Empire and the Alhambra, past Wylde's Globe and the Panopticon,
      past Burford's Panorama and Miss Linwood's needlework, we enter the last
      century, we are in the Leicester Fields of Reynolds and Hogarth, of Newton
      and John Hunter,&mdash;the Leicester Fields of Sir George Savile and
      Frederick, Prince of Wales, of Colbert and Prince Eugene. This is the
      Leicester Fields of which we propose to speak. Leicester Square and its
      notorieties may be left to the topographers of the future. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name 'Leicester Square'&mdash;it is but right to say&mdash;is
     also of fairly early date. In 'A Journey through England,'
     4th cd., 1724, 1778, the writer, speaking of the space
     before Leicester House, says: 'This was till these Fourteen
     Years always called Leicester-Fields, but now Leicester-
     Square.'' There is, however, abundant evidence that the
     older name continued to be freely used throughout the
     century. For example, in 1783, Mrs. Hogarth's house is
     advertised as 'The Golden Head, in Leicester Fields;' and it
     is "at his house in Leicester Fields,' in 1792, that Malone
     makes Reynolds die.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is in Ralph Agas his survey of 592 (or rather in Mr. W. H. Overall's
      excellent facsimile) that we make our first acquaintance with the Fields,
      then really entitled to their name. According to Agas, the ground to the
      north-west of Charing Cross, and immediately to the east of the present
      Whitcomb Street (at that time Hedge Lane) was formerly open pasture land,
      occupied&mdash;in the plan&mdash;by a pair of pedestrians larger than
      life, a woman laying out clothes, and two nondescript quadrupeds, of which
      one is broken-backed beyond the licence of deformity. The only erections
      to be discovered are the King's Mews, clustering together for company at
      the back of the Cross. Sixty years later, judging from the map known
      generally as Faithorne's, the locality had become more populated.. To the
      right of St. Martin's Lane it is thickly crowded with buildings; to the
      left also a line of houses is springing up and creeping northward; while
      in the open space above referred to stand a couple of lordly mansions.
      One, on a site which must have lain to the north of the present Little
      Newport Street, is Newport House, the town residence of Mountjoy Blount,
      Earl of Newport; the other, which occupies ground now traversed by
      Leicester Place, is Leicester House. Its garden at the back extended
      across the eastern end of Lisle Street, and its boundary wall to the north
      was also the southern boundary wall of the old Military Garden where King
      James's son, Prince Henry of Wales&mdash;whose gallant and martial
      presentment you shall see figured in the forefront of Michael Drayton's
      Poly-Olbion&mdash;had been wont to exercise his troops, and make the
      now-discredited welkin ring with the shooting-off of chambers, with
      alarums, and points of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester House the first was built about 1632-6 by Robert Sydney, 2nd
      Earl of Leicester, the father of Algernon Sydney and of that beautiful
      Dorothy, afterwards Countess of Sunderland, whom Van Dyck painted and
      Waller 'Petrarchized' as Sacharissa. The site (Swan Close) * was what is
      known as Lammas-land, and from the Overseers' books of the Parish of St.
      Martin's in the Fields, the Earl seems not only to have paid 'Lamas' for
      'the ground that adjoins to the Military Wall,' but also 'for the field
      that is before his house'&mdash;i.e. Leicester Fields.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Cunningham failed to identify Swan Close. But from a
     letter in the State Paper Office, quoted in 'Temple Bar' for
     June, 1874, it would seem that this was the aetual site of
     the building.
</pre>
    <p>
      This latter probably extended to the present Orange Street, so that the
      grounds of the old mansion may be roughly said to be bounded by the Mews
      on the south, and by the Military Garden on the north. Few memories cling
      about the place which belong to Lord Leicester's lifetime. When not
      engaged in embassies and the like, he was absent at his other and more
      famous seat of Penshurst in Kent, and Leicester House was 'To Let.' One of
      the earliest of its illustrious tenants was that quondam 'Queen of Hearts'
      (as Howell calls her), the unfortunate Elizabeth of Bohemia, who, already
      smitten with her last illness, died there in February, 1662, after a few
      days' residence, 'in the arms' (says Evelyn) 'of her nephew the King'
      [Charles II.]. Another tenant, some years later, was Charles Colbert,
      Marquis de Croissy, the French Ambassador, a brother of Louis the
      Fourteenth's famous minister and financier; and Pepys records, under date
      of 21st October, 1668, that he was to have taken part in a deputation from
      the Royal Society to Lord Leicester's distinguished lessee. But having
      unhappily been 'mighty merry' at a house-warming of his friend Batelier,
      he arrived too late to accompany the rest, and was fain to console himself
      (and perhaps to do penance) by carrying his wife to Cow Lane, Smithfield,
      in order to inspect a proposed new coach, with the splendours of which
      'she is out of herself for joy almost,' although, from the sequel, it was
      not the one ultimately purchased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepys, as will be seen, did not actually enter Leicester House, at all
      events upon this occasion. His brother diarist was more fortunate. Going
      in October, 1672, to take leave of the second Lady Sunderland
      (Sacharissa's daughter-in-law), whose husband had already set out as
      ambassador to Paris, grave John Evelyn was entertained by her Ladyship
      with the performances of Richardson the fire-eater, who, in those days,
      enjoyed a vogue sufficient to justify the record of his prowess in the
      'Journal des Sçavans' for 1680. 'He devour'd brimston on glowing coales
      before us,' says Evelyn, 'chewing and swallowing them; he mealted a
      beere-glasse and eate it quite up; then taking a live coale on his tongue,
      he put on it a raw oyster, the coal was blown on with bellows till it
      flam'd and sparkl'd in his mouth, and so remain'd till the oyster gaped
      and was quite boiled; then he mealted pitch and wax with sulphur, which he
      drank downe as it flam'd; I saw it flaming in his mouth a good while; he
      also tooke up a thick piece of yron, such as laundresses use to put in
      their smoothing-boxes, when it was fiery hot, held it betweene his teeth,
      then in his hand, and threw it about like a stone, but this I observ'd he
      car'd not to hold very long; then he stood on a small pot, and bending his
      body, tooke a glowing yron with his mouth from betweene his feete, without
      touching the pot or ground with his hands; with divers other prodigious
      feates.' *

    <p>
      Lord Leicester closed a long life in 1677, and many other tenants
      afterwards occupied the mansion in the Fields. Under Anne it was the home
      of the German Ambassador, or 'Imperial Resident,' who lived in it far into
      the reign of the first George. At this time, judging from a water-colour
      bird's-eye view in the Crace Collection at the British Museum, it was a
      long two-storeyed building, with attics above, a courtyard in front, and a
      row of small shops or stalls extending on either side of its entrance
      gate. Behind came the garden, stretching northward, and decorated in the
      Dutch fashion with formal trees and statues. Hither, on a Saturday in
      January, 1712, conveyed unostentatiously in a hackney coach from Whitehall
      Stairs, came Eugene of Savoy, who, by desire of the Emperor Charles VI.,
      had just crossed from the Hague in Her Majesty's 'Yatcht "Fubs"' (Captain
      Desborough), with the intention of preventing, if possible, what Prior
      calls that 'vile Utrecht Treaty.' His mission was to be fruitless from the
      outset, for at the Nore he was greeted with the news of Marlborough's
      disgrace, and his presence in England had little or no effect upon the
      pending proposals of peace. But for two months he was to be fêted and
      lionized by the nobility in a way which modest warrior and discreet
      diplomatist as he was&mdash;must have taxed his resources as much as a
      campaign in Flanders. His admirers mobbed him on all occasions. 'I could
      not see Prince Eugene at court to-day,'&mdash;writes Swift to Mrs. Johnson
      at Dublin,&mdash;'the crowd was so great. The Whigs contrive to have a
      crowd always about him, and employ the rabble to give the word when he
      sets out from any place.' Elsewhere Swift had said&mdash;'I hope and
      believe he comes too late to do the Whigs any good.' At first His
      Highness's appearance prepossessed him. He is not ill-looking, 'but well
      enough, and a good shape.' Later on he has revised his opinion. 'I saw
      Prince Eugene at court to-day very plain. He is plaguy yellow, and
      literally ugly besides.' A great Tory lady, Lady Strafford (wife of that
      haughty envoy to the Hague who declined to serve with Prior in the Utrecht
      negotiations) goes farther still. She calls him&mdash;her Ladyship spells
      far worse than Stella&mdash;a 'frittfull creature,' and adds, 'the Ladys
      here dont admire Prince Eugene, for he seemes to take very little notis of
      them,'&mdash;a sentiment in which we may perhaps detect a spice of the '<i>spreto
      injuria formho</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      Much, indeed, depends upon the point of view, political and otherwise. To
      Steele, with his military instincts and quick enthusiasm, the great
      Captain, who surprised Cremona and forced the trenches of Turin, comes
      surrounded with an aura of hyperbole. 'He who beholds him,' he writes in
      'Spectator,' No. 340, 'will easily expect from him anything that is to be
      imagined or executed by the Wit or Force of Man. The Prince is of that
      Stature which makes a Man most easily become all Parts of Exercise; has
      Height to be graceful on Occasions of State and Ceremony, and no less
      adapted for Agility and Dispatch: His Aspect is erect and compos'd; his
      Eye lively and thoughtful, yet rather vigilant than sparkling: His Action
      and Address the most easy imaginable, and his Behaviour in an Assembly
      peculiarly graceful in a certain Art of mixing insensibly with the rest,
      and becoming one of the Company, instead of receiving the Courtship of it.
      The Shape of his Person, and Composure of his Limbs, are remarkably exact
      and beautiful.' Burnet, as staunch a Whig as Steele, writes more
      moderately, to the same effect. 'I had the honour to be admitted at
      several times, to much discourse with him; his Character is so universally
      known, that I will say nothing of him, but from what appeared to myself.
      He has a most unaffected Modesty, and does scarcely bear the
      Acknowledgments, that all the World pay him: He descends to an easy
      Equality with those, with whom he converses; and seems to assume nothing
      to himself, while he reasons with others: He was treated with great
      respect by both Parties; but he put a distinguished Respect on the Duke of
      <i>Marlborough</i>, with whom he passed most of his Time. * The Queen used
      him civilly, but not with the Distinction, that was due to his high Merit:
      Nor did he gain much ground with the Ministers.' **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was for Marlborough, no doubt, that the Prince sat to
     Kneller. The portrait, in which he wears the Order of the
     Golden Fleece over a rich coat of armour, and holds a
     marshal'? baton, was mezzotinted by John Simon in this very
     year 1712

     ** 'History of His Own Time,' ii. (1731), pp. 589-90.

    <p>
      Eugene's stay at Leicester House was brief; but it must have been fully
      occupied. 'Je caressais beaucoup les gens en place,' he writes in his
      'Mémoires,' and it is clear that, however attentive he may have been to
      his fallen comrade-in-arms of Blenheim and Oudenarde, he did not omit to
      pay assiduous court to those in power. 'He has been every day entertain'd
      at some great man's,' says gossiping Peter Wentworth. Lord Portland gives
      him 'dinner, musick and a dancing' all at once; the Duke of Shrewsbury has
      Nicolini to sing for him; the Duke of Buckingham turns out the militia in
      his honour. And so forth. He, in his turn, was not backward in responding.
      'Prince Eugene,' says Lady Strafford, 'has given an order to six ladys and
      six men. The ladys are the four Marlborough daughters and the Duchess of
      Bolton and Lady Berkely. 'Tis a medall&mdash;Cupid on won side with a
      sword in won hand and a fann in the othere, and the othere side is Cupid
      with a bottle in his hand with a sword run through it. And the motto's are
      in French which I dare not write to you but the English "won don't hinder
      the othere" ["L'un n'empêche pas l'autre"].' He had arrived in London on
      January 5, and he returned to Holland on March 17, carrying with him
      nothing but the diamond hiked sword ('very rich and genteele, and the
      diamonds very white,' says Lord Berkeley of Stratton), which, at a cost of
      £5,000, had been presented to him by Queen Anne. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * If he received royal gifts, he was also princely in his
     acknowledgments. According to Hearne (Dohle, 1889, iii.
     329), he paid twenty guineas for Joshua Barnes's quarto
     'Homer' of 1711, and fifteen guineas for Wiston's
     'Heretical Book.' he also paid thirty guineas for Samuel
     Clarke's edition of 'Caesar's Commentaries (Tonson, 1712),'
     then just published with a magnificent portrait of
     Marlborough, to whom it was dedicated. A large paper copy of
     this, sumptuously bound, fetched sixteen guineas at Dr.
     Mead's sale of 1754-5; but though it is praised by Addison
     in 'Spectator,' No. 367, as doing 'Honour to the English
     Press,' Eugene certainly gave too much. Probably he meant to
     do so. 'Je fis des présens,' he says ('Mémoires,' 1811, p.
     107); 'ear'&mdash;he adds significantly&mdash;'on achète beaucoup en
     Angleterre.'
</pre>
    <p>
      After this Leicester House continued to be the home of the German
      Resident, apparently one Hoffmann, whom Swift calls a 'puppy.' But he had
      also called his predecessor, Count Gallas, a 'fool,' and too much
      importance may easily be attached to these flowers of faction. 'Scandal
      between Whig and Tory goes for nothing,' said Mrs. Manley of the 'New
      Atalantis'&mdash;and Mrs. Manley's knowledge was experimental. About 1718,
      the house, being again to let, was bought for £6,000 by George Augustus,
      Prince of Wales, who had quarrelled with his father; and a residence of
      the Prince of Wales it continued for forty years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was perhaps the gayest time in its history. From the precision and
      decorum of St. James's, people flocked eagerly to the drawing-rooms and
      receptions of Leicester House, where the fiddles were always going.
      'Balls, assemblies and masquerades have taken the place of dull formal
      visiting,' writes my Lord Chesterfield, 'and the women are more agreeable
      triflers than they were designed. Puns are extremely in vogue, and the
      license very great. The variation of three or four letters in a word
      breaks no squares, inasmuch, that an indifferent punster may make a very
      good figure in the best companies.' He himself was one of the most
      brilliant luminaries of that brilliant gathering, delighting the Prince
      and Princess by his mimicry and his caustic raillery. Another was that
      eccentric Duchess of Buckingham, who passed for the daughter of James II.
      by Catherine Sed-ley, Countess of Dorchester, and who always sat in a
      darkened chamber, in the deepest mourning, on the anniversary of King
      Charles's execution. Thus she was discovered by Lord Hervey, surrounded by
      servants in sables, in a room hung with black, and lighted only by wax
      candles. But the most attractive figures of the prince's Court are the
      youthful maids of honour,&mdash;charming, good-humoured Mary Bellenden,
      Mary Lepel (to whom a later paper of these 'Vignettes' has been devoted),
      * and reckless and volatile Sophia Howe. Pope and Gay wrote them verses,&mdash;these
      laughing ladies,&mdash;and they are often under contemporary pens.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See 'Mary Lepel, Lady Hervey,' in 'Eighteenth Century
     Vignettes,' 1806, pp. 293-323.
</pre>
    <p>
      Miss Bellenden married Colonel John Campbell, and became a happy wife; the
      'beautiful Molly Lepel' paired off with John, Lord Hervey, whose
      pen-portrait by Pope exhausts the arts of 'conscientious malevolence,'
      while poor Sophia Howe fell in love, but did not marry at all, and died in
      1726 of a broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in June, 1727, George II. passed from Leicester House to the throne
      of England, another Prince of Wales succeeded him,&mdash;though not
      immediately,&mdash;and maintained the traditions of an opposition Court.
      This was Frederick, Prince of Wales. Bubb Dodington, afterwards Lord
      Melcombe, was the Chesterfield of this new <i>régime</i>, and Miss
      Chudleigh and Lady Middlesex, its Bellenden and Lepel. Political intrigue
      alternated with gambling and theatricals. One of the <i>habitués</i> was
      the dancing master Desnoyers, whom Hogarth ridiculed; and French comedians
      made holiday. 'The town,' says a historian of the Square, 'was at this
      time full of gaiety&mdash;masquerades, ridottos, Ranelagh in full swing,
      and the Prince a prominent figure at all, for he loved all sorts of
      diversion, from the gipsies at Norwood, the conjurors and fortune-tellers
      in the bye-streets about Leicester Fields, and the bull-baits at
      Hockley-in-the-Hole, to Amorevoli at the Opera, and the Faussans in the
      ballet. When the news came of the Duke of Cumberland having lost the
      battle of Fontenoy in May, 1745, the Prince was deep in preparation for a
      performance at Leicester House of Congreve's masque of "The Judgment of
      Paris," in which he played Paris. He himself wrote a French song for the
      part, addressed to the three rival goddesses, acted by Lady Catherine
      Hanmer, Lady Fauconberg, and Lady Middlesex, the <i>dame régnante</i> of
      the time. It is in the high Regency vein:&mdash;

      'What signifies if Europe has a tyrant more or less, So we but pray
      Calliope Our verse and song to bless'&mdash;-proceeds this Anacreontic
      performance; and Walpole copies out its entire five stanzas to send to
      Mann at Florence. They miscarry, he says, 'in nothing but the language,
      the thoughts and the poetry,'&mdash;a judgment which is needlessly severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1751, an end came to these lighthearted junketings, when His
      Royal Highness quitted the scene almost precipitately from the breaking of
      an abscess in his side, caused by the blow of a cricket-ball at Cliveden.
      The Princess and her children continued to live in Leicester Fields until
      1766. Meanwhile, to the accompaniment of trumpets and kettledrums, the old
      house witnessed the proclamation of George III., and the marriage, in its
      great drawing-room, of the Princess Augusta to Ferdinand, Hereditary
      Prinee of Brunswick, one of the most popular heroes ever huzzaed to by an
      English mob. After this last occurrence, the only important event
      connected with royalty in the Fields is the death at Savile House on 29th
      December, 1765, of one of the princes. 'The King's youngest brother,
      Prince Frederick,' writes Walpole (with one of those Gallic affectations
      of phrase which roused the anger of Macaulay) 'is dead, of a dropsy and
      consumption: he was a pretty and promising boy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Savile House above referred to stood next to Leicester House on the
      west. Savile House, too, was not without its memories. It was here that
      Peter the Great had boozed with his pot companion, the Marquis of
      Caermarthen, who occupied it when the Czar made his famous visit to this
      country in 1698. More than one English home bore dirty testimony to the
      passage of the imperial savage and his suite, the decorous dwelling of
      John Evelyn in particular, at Sayes Court, Deptford, being made 'right
      nasty.' There is, however, no special record of any wrong to Savile House
      beyond the spilling, down the autocratic throat, of an 'intolerable deal
      of sack' and peppered brandy. In January, 1718, the house was taken by the
      Prince of Wales, and when, a little later, Leicester House was vacated by
      Lord Gower, a communication was opened between the two, the smaller being
      devoted to the royal children. It belonged originally to Aylesbury family,
      and came through them to the Saviles, one of whom was the Sir George
      Savile who is by some supposed to have sat for Goldsmith's Mr. Burchell.
      Sir George was its tenant in the riots of '80, when (as Dickens has not
      failed to remember in 'Barnaby Rudge') it was besieged by the rioters
      because he had brought in the Catholic Bill. 'Between Twelve and One
      O'clock Yesterday morning [June 6th]&mdash;says the 'Public Advertiser'&mdash;'a
      large Body [of rioters] assembled before Sir George Savile's House in
      Leicester Fields, and after breaking all the Windows, destroyed some of
      the Furniture.' They were finally dispersed by a party of the Horse
      Grenadier Guards, but not before they had torn up all the iron railings in
      front of the building, which they afterwards used effectively as weapons
      of offence. Burke, who had also supported the Bill, was only saved from a
      like fate by the exertions of sixteen soldiers who garrisoned his house in
      Charles Street, St. James's Square. With the later use of Savile House, as
      the home of Hiss Linwood's Art Needlework, which belongs to the present
      century, this paper has nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, we are straying from Leicester House itself. Deserted of
      royalty, it passed into the hands of Mr., afterwards Sir Ashton Lever
      (grand uncle of Charles Lever the novelist), who transferred to it in 1771
      the miscellaneous collection he had christened the 'Holophusikon'&mdash;a
      name which did not escape the gibes of the professional jester. His <i>omnium
      gatherum</i> of natural objects and savage costumes was, nevertheless, a
      remarkable one, still more remarkable when regarded as the work of a
      single man. It filled sixteen of the rooms at Leicester House, besides
      overflowing on the staircases, and included, not only all the curiosities
      Cook had brought home from his voyages, but also a valuable assortment of
      bows and arrows of all countries contributed by Mr. Richard Owen Cambridge
      of Twickenham. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See 'Cambridge the Everything,' in 'Eighteenth Century
     Vignettes,' 3rd series, 1896, p. 1847 In an outhouse of the
     'Holophusikon,' it may be added, were exhibited (stuffed)
     Queen Charlotte's elephant and female zebra&mdash;two favourites
     of royalty, which, during their lifetime, had enjoyed an
     exceptional, if not always enviable, notoriety.
</pre>
    <p>
      Its possessor had been persuaded that his treasures which, in their first
      home at Alkrington near Manchester, had enjoyed great popularity, would be
      equally successful in London. The result, however, did not justify the
      expectation (an admittance of 5s. 3d.. per person must have been
      practically prohibitive), and poor Sir Ashton was ultimately 'obligated,'
      as Tony Lumpkin would say, to apply to Parliament for power to dispose of
      his show, as a whole, by lottery. He estimated his outlay at £50,000. Of
      30,000 tickets issued at a guinea each, only 8,000 were taken up. The
      lottery was drawn in March, 1780, and the winner was a Mr. Parkinson, who
      transferred his prize to the Rotunda at the Southern or Surrey end of
      Blackfriars Bridge, changing its name to the Museum Leverianum. But it was
      foredoomed to misfortune, and in 1800 was dispersed under the hammer. A
      few years after it had crossed the river, Leicester House in turn
      disappeared, being pulled down in 1790. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A house in Lisle Street, looking down Leicester Place,
     still (1897) perpetuates the name, and bears on its façade
     in addition the words, 'New Lisle Street, mdccxci.' It is
     occupied by a foreign school or schools ('Ecoles de Notre
     Dame de France').
</pre>
    <p>
      In 1791 Lisle Street was continued across its garden; and a little later
      still, Leicester Place traversed its site, running parallel to Leicester
      Street, which had existed long previously, being described in 1720 'as
      ordinarily built and inhabited, except the west side, towards the Fields,
      where there is a very good house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester Place and Leicester Street,&mdash;like Leicester Fields itself,&mdash;directly
      preserve the memory of what Pennant aptly calls the 'pouting-place of
      Princes.' But there are other traces of Leicester House in the
      nomenclature of the neighbourhood which had grown up about it. One of the
      family titles survives in 'Lisle Street'; another in 'Sidney Alley.' Bear
      Street again recalls the Leicester crest, a bear and ragged staff, while
      Green Street (one side of which has been recently rebuilt), according to
      Wheatley and Cunningham, derives its name from the colour of the Leicester
      Mews, which stood to the south of the Fields. The central inclosure seems
      to have been first systematically laid out&mdash;though it had long been
      railed round&mdash;about 1737. Eleven years later arrived from Canons
      (Lord Burlington's seat at Edgeware) that famous equestrian statue of
      George I., which Londoners so well remember. At the time of its erection
      it was lavishly gilt, and was one of the popular sights of the Town. By
      some it was attributed to Buchard; by others to Van Nost of Piccadilly,
      then a fashionable statuary (in lead) like Cheere of Hyde Park Corner. The
      horse was modelled upon that by Hubert Le Sour which carries King Charles
      I. at Charing Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering its prolonged patronage by royalty, Leicester Fields does not
      seem to have been particularly favoured by distinguished residents.
      Charles Dibdin, the song-writer, once lived in Leicester Place, where in
      1796 (on the east side) he built a little theatre, the Sans Souci; * and
      Woollett, of whose velvety engravings Mr. Louis Fagan, not many years ago,
      prepared an exhaustive catalogue, had also his habitat in Green Street
      (No. 11), from the leads of which he was wont&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;to
      discharge a small cannon when he had successfully put the last touches to
      a 'Battle of La Hogue,' or a 'Death of General Wolfe.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. Tom Taylor ('Leicester Square,' 1874, pp. 306 and 456)
     says that Dibdin's Theatre stood nearly on the site of 'The
     Feathers,' Hogarth's house of call in the Fields. But if
     Leicester Place did not exist until 1796, and then occupied
     ground occupied six years before by Leicester House, it is
     difficult to connect Hogarth with any tavern in Leicester
     Place, as Hogarth died in 1764.
</pre>
    <p>
      Allan Ramsay (in his youth), Barry, and John Opie all once lodged in
      Orange Court (now Street); and here&mdash;at No. 13&mdash;was born, of a
      shoemaker sire and a mother who cried oysters, into a life of many
      changing fortunes, that strange Thomas Holcroft of the 'Road to Ruin.' In
      St. Martin's Street, next door to the Congregational Chapel on the east
      side, lived Sir Isaac Newton from 1710 until January 1725, or two years
      before his death at Kensington. Few traditions, however, connect the
      abstracted philosopher (he was nearing seventy when he came to the Fields)
      with the locality, beyond his visits to Princess Caroline at the great
      house opposite. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A so-ealled Observatory on the roof, now non-existent, was
     for many years exhibited at Newton's. Recent authorities,
     however, contend that this was the fabrication of a later
     tenant. But it should be noted that Madame D'Arblay, who
     also lived in the house, and wrote novels in the room in
     question, seems to have had no doubts of the kind. She says
     ('Memoirs of Dr. Burney,' 1832, i. 290-1) that her father
     not only reverently repaired the Observatory when he entered
     upon his tenancy of No. 35 [in 1774], but went to the
     expense of practically reconstructing it when it was all but
     destroyed by the hurricane of 1778.
</pre>
    <p>
      But there was one member of his household, a few years later, who must
      certainly have added to the attractions of the ordinary two-storeyed
      building where he superintended the revision of the second and third
      editions of the 'Prineipia.' This was his kinswoman,&mdash;the 'jolie
      niece' of Voltaire,&mdash;the 'famous witty Miss Barton' of the
      'Gentleman's Magazine.' At this date she was 'Superintendant of his
      domestick Affairs' to Charles, Earl of Halifax, who, dying in 1715, left
      her £5,000 and a house, 'as a Token'&mdash;so runs the bequest&mdash;'of
      the sincere Love, Affection, and Esteem I have long had for her Person,
      and as a small Recompence for the Pleasure and Happiness I have had in her
      Conversation.' This, taken in connection with the fact that, since 1706,
      she had been in receipt of an annuity of £200 a year, purchased in her
      uncle's name, but for which Halifax was trustee, has led to the conclusion
      that the relation between the pair was something closer than friendship,
      and that, following other contemporary precedents, they were privately
      married. * Be this as it may, Catherine Barton is also interesting as one
      of the group of gifted women to whom Swift extended the privilege of that
      half-patronising, half-playful, and wholly unconventional intimacy which
      is at once the attraction and the enigma of his relations with the other
      sex.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See 'Newton: his Friend: and his Niece,' 1885, by
     Professor Augustus de Morgan, which labours, with much
     digression, but with infinite ingenuity and erudition, to
     establish this satisfactory solution of a problem in which
     the good fame of Newton cannot be regarded as entirely
     unconcerned.
</pre>
    <p>
      He met her often in London, though not as often as he wished. 'I love her
      better than any-one here,' he tells Stella in April, 1711, 'and see her
      seldomer.' He dines with her 'alone at her lodgings'; he goes with her to
      other houses; and, Tory though he has become, endures her vivacious
      Whiggery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at Halifax's death, Catherine Barton, in all probability, returned
      to her uncle's house, Swift had already gone back to Ireland, and there is
      no reason for supposing that, although he had lodgings 'in Leicester
      Fields' in 1711, he ever visited his friend in St. Martin's Street. In
      August, 1717, Mrs. Barton married John Conduitt, M.P., Xewton's successor
      as Master of the Mint, and when in town continued to reside with her
      husband under Newton's roof. And though Halifax was dead, and Swift in
      exile, and Prior 'in the messenger's hand,' there can be little doubt that
      during her brief widowhood (?) and second wifehood, those friends who had
      clustered about the former toast of the Kit Cats must still have continued
      to visit her. The chairs of Lady Worsley and Lady Betty Germaine must
      often have waited in the narrow entrance to St. Martin's Street, while the
      ladies 'disputed Whig and Tory' with Mrs. Conduitt, or were interrupted in
      their <i>tête-à-tête</i> by Gay and his Duchess. After Sir Isaac&mdash;a
      long while after&mdash;the most notable tenant of the old house was Dr.
      Charles Burney, author of the 'History of Music,' and of Fanny Burney.
      Indeed, it was in this very building&mdash;with the unassuming little
      chapel on its right where 'Rainy Day' Smith had often heard Toplady preach&mdash;that
      a mere girl in her teens&mdash;no, ungallant Mr. Croker discovered her to
      have been actually a young woman of five-and-twenty&mdash;wrote that
      'Evelina' which, in 1778, took the Town by storm. There were panelled
      rooms and a painted ceiling in the Newton-Burney house of yore, but it
      could scarcely be here that the little person whom in her graver moments
      Mrs. Piozzi nicknamed the 'Lady Louisa of Leicester Square' danced round
      an unmetaphoric mulberry tree with delight at her success in letters, for
      there are no traces of a garden. At present, in this quiet backwater of
      street traffic, where Burke and Johnson and Franklin and Reynolds all came
      formerly to visit their favourite authoress, nothing is discoverable but a
      dingy tenement with dusty upper windows, with a ground floor that is used
      as a day school, and a front of stucco'd red brick upon which the blue
      tablet of the Society of Arts has something of the forlorn effect of an
      order of merit upon a shoeblack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning out of St. Martin's Street on the north another tablet is
      discernible in the angle of the Fields to the right upon the comparatively
      modern red brick <i>façade</i> of another school, known as Archbishop
      Tenison's. Here, at one of the many signs of the 'Golden Head,' lived
      William Hogarth. * The golden head in his case was rudely carved by
      himself out of pieces of cork glued together, and represented Van Dyck. To
      this, says Nichols, succeeded a head in plaster; and this again, when
      Nichols wrote in 1782, had been replaced by a bust of Newton. About the
      interior of the house very little seems to be known, but, as it was rated
      to the poor in 1756 at £60, it must have been fairly roomy. In the later
      days, when it formed part of the Sablonière Hotel, before the hotel made
      way for the existing school, there were traditions of a studio, probably
      far less authentic than those of Sir Isaac's ob* There was even another,
      in Hogarth's day, in the Fields itself. 'At the Golden Head.' on the south
      side (Hogarth's was on the east), lived Edward Fisher, the mezzotint
      engraver, to whom we owe so many brilliant plates after Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many years after Hogarth first took the house, the square was laid out
      (it had long been railed in), and he is said to have been often seen
      walking in the inclosure, wrapped in his red roquelaure, with his hat
      cocked on one side like Frederick the Great. His stables, when he set up
      the fine coach which Charles Catton decorated for him with the famous
      Cyprian crest that figures at the bottom of 'The Bathos,' were in Nag's
      Head Yard, Orange Street. He had&mdash;as we know&mdash;a country box at
      Chiswick; but he was at home in Leicester Fields. His friends were about
      him. Kind old Captain Coram had lodgings somewhere in the neighbourhood;
      Pine, the 'Friar Pine' of 'Calais Gate,' lived in St. Martin's Lane;
      beyond that, in Covent Garden and its vicinity, were George Lambert the
      scene painter, Saunders Welch the magistrate, Richard Wilson, Fielding,
      and a host of intimates. It was in Leicester Fields that Hogarth died. He
      had been driven there from Chiswick on the 25th October, 1764, cheerful,
      but very weak. 'Receiving an agreeable letter from the <i>American Dr.
      Franklin</i>,' says Nichols, [he] 'drew up a rough draught of an answer to
      it; but going to bed, he was seized with a vomiting, upon which he rung
      his bell with such violence that he broke it, and expired about two hours
      afterwards in the arms of Mrs. Mary Lewis, who was called up on his being
      taken suddenly ill. He is buried in Chiswick churchyard, where some years
      subsequently a monument was erected to his memory, with a well-known
      epitaph by Garrick. After Hogarth's death his widow continued to keep up
      the 'Golden Head,' and Mary Lewis sold his prints there. Richard Livesay,
      the engraver, was one of Widow Hogarth's lodgers, and the Scotch painter,
      Alexander Runciman, was another. If the house had any further notable
      occupants, they may be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hogarth herself died in 1789. Six years before her death she had a
      next-door neighbour in the Fields, who, in his way, was as illustrious as
      Hogarth or Reynolds. This was John Hunter, who, in 1783, became the tenant
      of No. 28, * and at once began extending it backward towards Castle Street
      (now the Charing Cross Road) to receive his famous museum of Comparative
      and Pathological Anatomy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * At present (1897) being rebuilt by the Alhambra Company as
     part of their premises.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hogarth had then been dead for nearly twenty years; and it is unlikely
      that the painter knew much of the young surgeon who was subsequently to
      become so celebrated; but he was probably acquainted with his brother,
      William Hunter of Covent Garden, who attended Fielding in 1754. William
      Hunter had just died when John Hunter came to Leicester Fields. He lived
      there ten years in the height of his activity and fame, and it was during
      this period that Reynolds painted that portrait of him in a reverie (now
      in the Council Room of the College of Surgeons), which was engraved by
      William Sharp. He survived Sir Joshua but one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of Reynolds was at the opposite side of the Square, at No. 47,
      now Puttick and Simpson's auction rooms. He occupied it from 1760 to 1792.
      We are accustomed to think of Hogarth and Reynolds as contemporaries. But
      Reynolds was in the pride of his prime when he came to Leicester Fields,
      while Hogarth was an old and broken man, whose greatest work was done.
      Apart from this, there could never have been much real sympathy between
      them. Hogarth, whose own efforts as a portrait-painter were little
      appreciated in his life time, must have chafed at the carriages which
      blocked up the doorway of his more fortunate brother; while Reynolds,
      courtly and amiable as he was, capable of indulgence even to such a
      caricaturist as Bunbury, could find for his illustrious neighbour, when he
      came to deliver his famous Fourteenth Discourse, no warmer praise than
      that of 'successful attention to the ridicule of life.' These things,
      alas! are the commonplaces of literature and art. It is pleasanter to
      think of No. 47 filled with those well-known figures of whom we read in
      Boswell and Madame D'Arblay;&mdash;with Burke and Johnson and Goldsmith
      and Gibbon and Garrick;&mdash;with graceful Angelica, and majestic
      Siddons, and azure-stockinged Montagu;&mdash;with pretty Nelly O'Brien and
      charming Fanny Abington;&mdash;with all the crowd of distinguished
      soldiers, sailors, lawyers and literati who by turns filled the sitter's
      chair * in the octagonal painting-room, or were ushered out and in by the
      silver-laced footmen.

      Then there were those wonderful disorderly dinners, where the guests were
      so good and the feast so indifferent; where there were always wit and
      learning, and seldom enough of knives and forks; where it was an honour to
      have talked and listened, and no one remembered to have dined. Last comes
      that pathetic picture of Sir Joshua, when his sight had failed him,
      wandering sadly in the inclosure with his green shade over his eyes, and
      peering wistfully and vainly for the lost canary which had been wont to
      perch upon his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Reynolds died, Burke wrote his eulogy in the very house where his
      body lay. The manuscript (which still exists) was blotted with its
      writer's tears. Those royal periods in which the great orator spoke of his
      lost friend are too familiar to quote. But after Sir Joshua, the interest
      seems to fade out of the Fields, and one willingly draws one's pen through
      the few remaining names that are written in its chronicles.

      Note 4, p. 211.&mdash;Bronze statue of King James the Second. This statue,
      first placed in Whitehall Gardens on the 31st December, 1686 (Bramston's
      Autobiography, 1845, p. 253), was transferred in 1897 to an inclosure at
      the side of Gwydyr House. The present writer well remembers its forlorn
      departure, prone on a trolly, with one leg stiffly extended. It has again
      been moved; and now stands at the back of the Admiralty, where it will
      doubtless give rise to fresh traditions as to the site of the execution of
      Charles I.

      Note d, p. 219.&mdash;Ink-bottles... dangling from their button-holes.
      Flaxman, when he lived in Poland Street, used, in his capacity of parish
      officer, to collect the watch rates. On these occasions he always wore an
      ink-bottle at his buttonhole. Johnson also bustled about thus accoutred at
      the sale of Thrale's brewery (Birkbeck Hill's Boswell, 1887, iv. 87).

      Note G, p. 324.&mdash;Hogarth's... gold ticket. This is now in the
      possession of Mr. Fairfax Murray, who bought it at the Forman sale. But
      recent authorities doubt if the design was Hogarth's own.

      Note 7, p. 349.&mdash;Her Majesty's 'Yatcht' 'Fubs.' This absurd name,
      according to a writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> for 6th October, 1883,
      had been given to Queen Anne's royal yacht by Charles II., in honour of
      'Madam Carwell,' who was 'fubsy' or plump.

      Note 8, p. 372.&mdash;Danced round an unmetaphoric mulberry tree. Miss
      Burney's historic performance took place, as a matter of fact, at
      Chessington, the Surrey hermitage of her friend and critic, 'Daddy' Crisp.
      It was the uncontrollable outcome of her exhilaration at the praise which,
      she was informed, Dr. Johnson had bestowed upon her first novel, Evelina.
      'It gave me such a flight of spirits, that I danced a jig to Mr. Crisp,
      without any preparation, music, or explanation&mdash;to his no small
      amazement and diversion (Diary, etc., of Madame D'Arblay, 1904-5, i. 49).
